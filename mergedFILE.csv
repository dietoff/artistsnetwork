":mentalKLINIK,http://ivde.net/artists/mentalklinik_1/biography</Address>
:mentalKLINIK is an artist duo from <Location>Istanbul</Location> composed of Yasemin Baydar (B.<Date>1972</Date>, İstanbul) and Birol Demir (B.1967, <Location>Ankara</Location>) who began their collaborative works in <Date>1998</Date>, forming an open laboratory to reconsider process, production and presentation. Their studio has functioned as a space for dialogue and they enrich their process by engaging other artists and professionals in fields ranging from chemistry to industrial engineering.
The collaborative resist the limitations posed by a singular vocabulary or style and craft material and digital technologies into works that seem to belong to anticipated aesthetics. Their works range from immersive time based works and installations to sculptures and objects that thwart categorization. Publications often accompany projects to reflect their interactive process, and include a form of documentation seeking to explore concepts and contexts pertaining to emotions, behaviour, viewpoints and senses.
Their work also engages the public in live and embodied installations. Terribly Jolly (<Location>Istanbul</Location>, <Date>2013</Date>) for example is a pop-up dance club contained within a small red curtained room that begins at nine am and lasts just thirty minutes, folding together the time of work and leisure to cut short any possibility of shared pleasure. By contrast FRESHCUT (<Organization>Museum of Applied Arts</Organization>, <Location>Vienna</Location>, <Date>2013</Date>) invites the audience to cut and arrange a massive installation of flowers, transforming them into actors in an augmented cinematic reality.

"Abdul Qadir al-Rassam,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Abdul-Qadir-al-Rassam.aspx</Address>
Abdul Qadir al-Rassam (<Date>1882 - 1952</Date>) was part of the first generation of modern <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> painters. He stands at the core of a group of artists trained in <Location>Istanbul</Location> who brought their artistic knowledge back to their home country. This group of soldier-artists is credited with introducing easel painting to <Location>Iraq</Location> at the turn of the century. Working in a realist style, al-Rassam is known for his sweeping landscapes, immaculate portraits, and faithful portrayals of everyday life in <Location>Iraq</Location>. He is one of the most prominent and prolific painters in <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s modern art history and his work heavily influenced the generations that followed.
Al-Rassam was among a group of <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> officers to study military science and art in <Location>Istanbul</Location>. He began his education around 1904 when the Ottoman Empire was still the main power in the region. As part of his education in <Location>Istanbul</Location>, al-Rassam and his classmates were required to produce paintings or drawings for military use. These images adhered to a strict European academic style. Eager to cultivate their new skill, these officers sought out private art training. Al-Rassam himself studied under a number of prominent painters living in <Location>Istanbul</Location> who worked in contemporary <Origin>French</Origin> styles. Although he is most recognizable as an oil painter, al-Rassam experimented at this time with watercolors representing <Location>Istanbul</Location> with its crowds and markets. Even at this early stage in his career, the painter showed expert skill and a conscientious eye. Al-Rassam&apos;s ambitions were interrupted by the outbreak of WWI. Directly following the war, when the group of soldier-artists returned to <Location>Iraq</Location>, al-Rassam again took up easel painting. Along with his colleagues, he focused on landscapes, military scenes, and archaeological sites. 
An important characteristic of this initial generation was their desire to stimulate awareness and appreciation of the arts amongst the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> population. Al-Rassam taught painting lessons out of his studio in <Location>Baghdad</Location> and encouraged young artists to continue their art training abroad. Due to this early artistic proselytizing, al-Rassam became hugely influential to the following generations of artists. The painter&apos;s interest in promoting art awareness was further realized when he became an honorary member of the <Organization>Society of the Friends</Organization> of Art, a group that sought to cultivate public interest in art making and to enhance their own skill through interaction.    
Utilizing the same academic style as his early colleagues, al-Rassam painted with a crisp realism capturing vistas of the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> countr​yside. The clarity found in oil paints is employed to its fullest advantage by the artist, who is known for his mastery of perspective and detail. He oftentimes painted panoramic views of historical sites along the <Location>Tigris River</Location>. The ruins of Ctesiphon or the Great Mosque of Samarra were particularly notable representations in al-Rassam&apos;s oeuvre. Indeed the <Location>Tigris River</Location> was itself the central theme of many of al-Rassam&apos;s canvases. Winding as it recedes through an expert use of atmospheric perspective, the river and the activities surrounding it compose a vast, yet serene, landscape.
Al-Rassam was also to a lesser extent a portraitist. One of his well-known portraits is of Mohamed Darouich al-Allousi, completed in <Date>1924</Date>. The bearded sitter gazes out at the viewer with a directed stare. He is set against a background of clouds that are ever-present in most of al-Rassam&apos;s canvases. The subtleties of the face show the painter&apos;s mastery of modeling and the poignant gaze reflect his skill as a keen observer. The portrait exhibits the same attention to clarity and detail as al-Rassam&apos;s landscapes.
A collection of al-Rassam&apos;s works was held at the <Organization>Pioneers Museum</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location> and the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> <Organization>Museum of Modern Art</Organization> until the destruction and the looting of the collection of the museum in <Date>2003</Date>. He also created a mural for the entrance of a movie theater in <Location>Baghdad</Location>, The Royal Cinema. This was the first large-scale work of art to be displayed on a public building. Later in his life, the artist travelled to <Location>Italy</Location>, <Location>France</Location>, <Location>Germany</Location>, and <Location>England</Location> to expand his knowledge of art.

A large and colorful image of Al Salam Park in <Location>Riyadh</Location> and a smaller still life of four traditional pots both celebrated the decorative side of human life. A similar observation when studying work the artist has posted on Flickr. Finding beauty in everyday spaces, such as in a hospital operation room, is an art not many people master. Al-Ogaili does however. Add a slight touch of color to your life and the artist might come and take your portrait. He has won at least one prize abroad with his portrait photography and shows a number of serious portraits of shaikhs and business leaders online.

&quot;a striking textural painting by Abdullah Idrees, at first seemingly of a decorated door, shows panels with a face behind it. The thought behind the piece is to raise the question whether the figure is evaluating the viewer from behind a cultural barrier or whether the viewer is sympathizing with what he assumes is a prisoner. If there is a consistency in the exhibition, it is the idea of duality, alternative viewpoints and conflicting though reconcilable perspectives.&quot;

"Abdulnasser Gharem&apos;s,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-abdulnassergharem.html</Address>
Abdulnasser Gharem&apos;s (<Date>1973</Date>) mission is to restore behaviour to a higher standard, remembered from the past, while taking into account new technologies and insights. The artist from the town of <Location>Khamis</Location> Mushait is a luitenant-colonel of artillery (now in administration), who aims at the brains and not the bone structure of life&apos;s realities. Do not put your trust in concrete, when planning battles of the future, is what Gharem says by selecting his own ground to fire from with weapons of his choice. The training shows. The &apos;art people&apos; call it performance art. People of performance might call it art of survival.
Gharem entered the field at the <Location>Sharjah</Location> <Date>2007</Date> biennial documenting a &apos;survival&apos; performance Flora and Fauna (<Date>2006</Date>) in which he wrapped himself in plastic with a tree on a busy road in the town of <Location>Abha</Location>. He stayed in his greenhouse for several hours living of the oxygen that the tree was meant to produce. The foreign imported Conocarpus Erectus tree is much used in city landscaping in the <Location>Middle East</Location> and elsewhere, but is said to have a disastrous effect on the local tree population. Dealing directly with ecological concerns of urban planning the performance in a much broader sense may have reflected on the dangers of thoughtless adoption of foreign ideas.
&apos;People at first thought he was crazy,&apos; is what Gharem told Henry Hemming in an interview for the <Organization>Edge of Arabia</Organization> (<Date>2008</Date>) exhibition. But then they started to appreciate his operations on the roads of <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. &apos;Their minds are not closed so they came over to ask about it.&apos; Reforming people&apos;s ideas about art away from copying Italians may be collateral damage his work inflicts.
Another maneuvre of speed and impact was in support not of flora but of Homo Erectus himself. In Manzoa (<Date>2007</Date>) Gharem moved himself around for a day and night in a so called &apos;unorganized residential district&apos; from which both the residents and houses were to be removed for new development. The name of the performance is Arabic for &apos;removal.&apos; It was written on the houses to announce their fate and that of their residents and the artist had it written on his shirt during the performance.
From chance of seeing a broken bridge and learning its history Gharem welded his conceptually most voluptuous work. Al-Siraat was made in the night of <Date>August 19, 2007</Date> when the artist and his assistents covered the whole bridge with one word: al-siraat (the path). The bridge, which is in a ravine in the Tihama region, had been abandoned since it collapsed in <Date>1982</Date>. Its tragic history is that it was used by people, trusting the concrete, as a refuge to shelter from an expected flash flood. From the idea that even concrete roads and bridges can&apos;t be trusted Gharem crossed over to associate the bridge with &apos;the path&apos; in the spiritual sense of the word. &apos;It is about the choices you make in life, and whether or not you follow the straight path,&apos; is what he said about it. The work was documented by photography and in a video with a touch of irony.
Al-Siraat became part of a controversy in the <Origin>British</Origin> press when it was reported that the work had not been included in the <Organization>Edge of Arabia</Organization> exhibition by a decision unclearly defined as having been taken by either a sponsor, guest curators or The <Organization>School of Oriental and African Studies</Organization>.
In both a visual and conceptual parallel to Al Siraat Gharem produced an alternative work of art for the exhibition intended to convey a similar message. For his Restored Behavior (<Date>2008</Date>) series the artist went on a humoristic adventure of subverting bureaucracy by buying in shops all over <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location> as many office stamps as he could find. Taking out the rubber letters and numbers, glueing them on boards and then painting over them a yellow road line he created anew an image of &apos;the path.&apos; Not having yourself stamped but painting your own way over stamps is not unlike &apos;not trusting concrete.&apos; In the paintings the bridge crossing the ravine was changed by Gharem into a Pedestrian Crossing. And like the bridge the crossing collapsed: the two stripes of the Zebra contained an image of the Twin Towers at the moment of impact of the second airplane. As a final salvo of his serious intentions Gharem produced an oversized and useable stamp which read in both hope and irony and in both Arabic and <Origin>English</Origin>: &apos;Have a bit of commitment, Amin.&apos; With it were three road lights to guide you in the dark. Using science in darkness may be the concept.
His motto: &apos;I will&apos;

"Abdulnasser Gharem,http://nadour.org/artists/abdulnasser-gharem/</Address>
Art of Survival – this stands as a kind of preliminary statement to all the work of this artist born in <Date>1973</Date> in <Location>Khamis Mushait</Location>, <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. Abdulnasser Gharem is surely the only artist to be both a leading figure on his country’s emerging art scene and a major in the <Origin>Saudi</Origin> army.
His story began in <Date>2003</Date> when Abdulnasser Gharem, an army recruit, enrolled in the Al-Miftaha <Location>Arts Village</Location> in <Location>Abha</Location>, <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. Founded a few years earlier by Ahmed Mater, this institution soon became the nerve centre of the new art scene that was represented in the <Date>2004</Date> exhibition Shattah, which captured the renewal of the <Origin>Saudi Arabian</Origin> scene.
From now on, Gharem began using the street as his studio, working in response to his local context. In numerous performances and site-specific installations he drew attention to ecological, geographical, urban and societal issues, recording his actions on video or in photographs. At the same time he was working on a series of stamp paintings in which major events are juxtaposed with the excesses of a bureaucratic system that seems capable of expressing itself only by rubberstamping.
Acclaimed by international critics and now recognised in the <Location>Middle East</Location>, his work was presented at the 53rd <Organization>Venice Biennale</Organization> in <Date>2009</Date> and at the 8th <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization> in <Date>2007</Date>. His works have been seen in <Location>Venice</Location>, <Location>London</Location>, <Location>Berlin</Location> and <Location>Riyad</Location> as part of exhibitions organised by <Organization>Edge of Arabia</Organization>.

"Adam Henein,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Adam-Henein.aspx</Address>
Adam Henein was born in <Location>Cairo</Location> into a family of silversmiths from Asyut and grew up in the neighborhood of Bab al-Shaariyya. He was eight years old when he discovered the <Organization><Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Museum of Antiquities</Organization> during a class visit, which he would later recall as a turning point in his life. At the age of twenty, he decided to become a sculptor and joined the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>. After he graduated in <Date>1953</Date>, he traveled to Upper <Location>Egypt</Location> and spent several months at the <Location>Luxor</Location> Atelier established in <Date>1941</Date> by the Alexandrian painter and diplomat Mohammed Naghi (<Date>1888 - 1956</Date>) to promote the study of ancient <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> art as part of the curriculum of art schools in <Location>Egypt</Location>.
In 1957, he received a scholarship for two years to pursue his studies at the <Organization>Academy of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Munich</Location>. During one of his exhibitions in <Date>1960</Date>, he met the anthropologist Afaf al-Dib, who became his wife and supporter as both manager and critic at the beginning of his career. Henein established his home and studio in <Date>1968</Date> in a mud brick house built by architect Ramsis Wissa Wassef (<Date>1911 - 1974</Date>) in the village of <Location>Harraniyya</Location>. In <Date>1971</Date>, Henein and his wife moved to <Location>Paris</Location>, where they stayed for twenty-five years. During that period, he dedicated himself to his art in his studio in the fifteenth arrondissement near Porte de Sèvres. By the time he returned to <Location>Egypt</Location> in <Date>1996</Date>, Henein was an internationally recognized artist. <Date>From 1989 to 1998</Date>, he worked with the <Organization>Ministry of Culture</Organization> in restoring the Sphinx in Giza. In <Date>1996</Date>, he founded the <Organization>Aswan International</Organization> Sculpture Symposium, an annual workshop and exhibition inviting sculptors from around the world to experiment and create works from the local granite.
Adam Henein is one of the most prominent contemporary sculptors of the Arab World. Throughout his career, he produced a considerable number of large and small-scale pieces, using a variety of materials, such as granite, bronze, plaster, limestone and terracotta. His early works embody the graceful solidity of ancient <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> statuary and express a sense of simplicity in the treatment of mass and volumes. They recall ancient sculptures, such as the scribe commonly known as the &quot;Sheikh el-Balad,&quot; now at the <Organization><Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Museum of Antiquities</Organization>, as well as the works of Mahmoud Mokhtar (<Date>1891 - 1934</Date>). During the 1960&apos;s, Henein sculpted a series of animals, such as birds, cats, dogs, owls, goats, horses and donkeys, expressing just their minimal and essential lines and features. 
The beginning of the <Date>1970</Date>&apos;s marked an important evolution in his art, as a result of being exposed to the work of modern sculptors in <Location>Paris</Location>, such as Brancusi. Even though Henein never belonged to a specific movement, he was inspired by their freedom of interpretation. During the <Date>1980</Date>&apos;s, abstract forms, pure volumes and the dynamic of movement characterize his sculptures, centered on the themes of sun and moon disks, as well as vertical ascension. In the <Date>1990</Date>&apos;s, he worked on several outdoor large-scale sculptures, including The Ship, conceived as a metaphorical alternative to the museum space. Overall, his work embodies a sense of simple monumentality and timelessness.
Henein has held many individual exhibitions in <Location>Cairo</Location>, <Location>Alexandria</Location>, <Location>Amsterdam</Location>, <Location>London</Location>, <Location>Paris</Location>, and <Location>Rome</Location>, and participated in numerous group exhibitions around the world. His works can be seen at his Museum in <Location>Harraniyya</Location> inaugurated in <Date>January 2014</Date>, the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> Art in <Location>Cairo</Location>, as well as at Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>, which includes his monumental sculpture of The Ship located in front of its entrance.

"Adeel Uz Zafar,http://www.lawrieshabibi.com/artists/49-adeel-uz-zafar/overview/</Address>
Adeel uz Zafar is known for his unique and meticulous scratching technique. His early practice involved engraving exposed photographic sheets with a paper cutter which was the base of his empirical observation and the development of his technique. Today Zafar works in minute detail on a large scale of black plastic vinyl sheets featuring gauzed stuffed animal toys completely alien to traditional <Origin>Pakistani</Origin> society. Zafar&apos;s work is both terrifying and amusing. His subject matters wrapped in bandages evoke childhood anxiety, turning comforting objects into monstrous figures. He gives his work a sinister feel by bandaging his objects and hiding them from view hinting to the loss of innocence and to the disintegration of the socio-political framework in <Location>Pakistan</Location> and to the pain that results.
Adeel uz Zafar was born in <Location>Karachi</Location>, <Location>Pakistan</Location> in <Date>1975</Date>. He completed his BFA from the <Organization>National College</Organization> (<Organization>NCA</Organization>) <Location>Lahore</Location>, graduating in <Date>1988</Date> and in <Date>2008</Date> joined <Organization>Indus Valley School</Organization> of Art.

"Adham Wanly,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Adham-Wanly.aspx</Address>
Ibrahim Adham Wanly was born in <Date>1908</Date> in the neighborhood of <Date>Muharram</Date> Bey in <Location>Alexandria</Location>. His father, Ismaïl Bey Mohammed Wanly was of <Origin>Turkish</Origin> origin and his mother, Ismat Hanem al-Daghistani, was from Caucasia. <Organization>Adham</Organization> grew up, with his four sisters and his elder brother Seif in an aristocratic intellectual francophone environment and was educated by private tutors in the family palace of Urfan <Organization>Pacha</Organization>. <Organization>Adham</Organization> worked as the director of the book warehouse at the <Organization>Education Authority</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location>.
Wanly first studied oil painting with his brother, Seif, in the studio of the <Origin>Italian</Origin> painter Arturo Zanieri (<Date>1870 - 1955</Date>) who had also been the teacher of Alexandrian painter <Organization>Mahmoud</Organization> Saïd (<Date>1897 - 1964</Date>). In 1929, the <Origin>Italian</Origin> painter, Ottorino Bicchi (<Date>1878 - 1949</Date>), educated at the Academy in <Location>Florence</Location>, opened a studio in <Location>Alexandria</Location> and the Wanly brothers were among his first students. When Bicchi closed his studio and returned to <Location>Italy</Location> before the Second World War, the Wanly brothers together with their friends, the painter Ahmad Fahmi and the filmmaker Mohammed Bayoumi, opened their own studio in <Location>Alexandria</Location> in <Date>1935</Date>.
During the 1950&apos;s, <Organization>Adham</Organization> and his brother traveled to many European countries including <Location>France</Location>, <Location>Italy</Location> and <Location>Spain</Location>, where they sketched and painted numerous landscapes, as well as ballet, opera and theater performances. In 1957, the Wanly brothers were appointed as professors at the <Organization>Faculty of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location> founded the same year by the sculptor Ahmad Osman (<Date>1907 - 1970</Date>). Two years later, they were appointed by the <Organization>Ministry of Culture</Organization> to participate in recording the Nubian architectural heritage in <Location>Aswan</Location> before the area was due to be flooded by the construction of the High Dam . During that mission, along with many artists and professors of their generation, they produced numerous paintings and sketches of the Nubian vernacular villages and ancient temples. Adham Wanly died in <Date>1959</Date> at the age of fifty-one in al-Moassat hospital in <Location>Alexandria</Location>. After his death, the street next to his studio in <Location>Alexandria</Location> was named after him.
Adham Wanly, like his brother Seif, was a prolific artist. His early works are influenced by his <Origin>Italian</Origin> teacher, Ottorino Bicchi, who was close to the <Origin>Italian</Origin> macchiaioli, a group influenced by the <Origin>French</Origin> impressionist movement and the École de Barbizon. Bicchi introduced the Wanly brothers to outdoor painting and capturing the light, colors and shades of nature. <Organization>Adham</Organization> was later influenced by modern pictorial trends, such as cubism and fauvism. Together with his brother, he developed a passion for performance arts, such as circus, ballet and theater and captured the vibrant and dynamic movements of the performers on stage.
<Organization>Adham</Organization> also painted numerous landscapes of Alexandria, as well as views of <Location>Cairo</Location> and many European cities. With his brother Seif, he participated regularly in the Salons in <Location>Alexandria</Location> and <Location>Cairo</Location>, as well as in the Alexandria Biennale. In addition to being a painter, he was also a talented caricaturist and during the 1930&apos;s, he regularly published his satirical drawings in <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> newspapers and reviews, such al Ruz al-Yusuf. His works can be seen at the Seif and <Organization>Adham Wanly Museum</Organization> hosted in the villa of the <Organization>Mahmoud Saïd Museum</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location>, the <Organization>Museum of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location>, the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> Art in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>, as well as in numerous private collections around the world."

"Ahmad Amin Nazar,http://ivde.net/artists/ahmad_amin_nazar_1/biography</Address>
Amin Nazar (b. 1955, <Location>Iran</Location>) studied fine art in <Location>Tehran</Location>, and after eight years in <Location>Cologne</Location>, <Location>Germany</Location>, where he joined the <Organization>Society of Painters</Organization> of <Location>Cologne</Location> and was widely exposed to Western art, returned to <Location>Iran</Location>. Upon his return, he began predominantly working in etching, exploring relationships between miniaturist traditions and <Origin>Iranian</Origin> literature, and went on to develop a masterful draughtmanship. His work manifests the discordance between traditions, both from <Location>Iran</Location> and the West, and modernity. Persian epics, legendary figures, social leaders and macho wrestlers are transformed into disturbed, witty, violent and sensual studies, ink drawings and acrylic masterpieces. The artist has taught drawing to younger generations of <Origin>Iranian</Origin> artists at <Organization>Tehran University</Organization> as well as privately for many years.
Amin Nazar belongs to a lost generation of <Origin>Iranian</Origin> artists who, due to historical circumstances, were drowned out in the midst of ideological, political, cultural and violent turmoil. As a result, he became profoundly reclusive, seeking refuge and absolute release in his studio, and in his raw, instinctive works.
Despite shying away from the public eye, Amin Nazar’s works are surfacing internationally, most recently with the acquisition of the <Organization>British Museum</Organization> of two works on paper of wrestlers, one of which was exhibited as part of the ‘Fair Play: heroes, athletes and princes in Islamic art’ exhibition, <Date>2012</Date>."

While his early works employ characteristics of <Origin>Italian</Origin> classicism, towards the end of the 1930&apos;s he started sculpting a series of bronzes representing busts of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> peasant women. These sculptures are characterized by their realism in depicting the features of the peasants and daily rural activities. They embody the simplicity and joyfulness of rural life, which he often expressed through a smiling <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> peasant. Osman also specialized in ornamental sculptures and was commissioned to decorate several public buildings. In 1936, together with his colleague, the sculptor Mansour Farag, he created the reliefs to decorate the entrance gate of the Zoological <Location>Garden</Location> in Giza designed by architect Mustafa Fahmi (<Date>1886 - 1972</Date>). In 1947, he sculpted the bronze reliefs decorating the pedestal of the monument to commemorate Ibrahim Pasha on the <Organization>Opera</Organization> square in <Location>Cairo</Location>, which was created by the <Origin>French</Origin> sculptor Charles Cordier (<Date>1829 - 1905</Date>).
Under Gamal Abdel Nasser, Osman was commissioned to sculpt the exterior façades of the <Organization>Officers Club</Organization> in Zamalek and the <Organization>Armed Forces Club</Organization> in Heliopolis, as well as the monumental stylized bronze eagle above the entrance of the <Location>Cairo</Location> Tower in <Date>1961</Date>. Osman was also a talented painter and produced a series of feminine and masculine nudes with charcoal, as well as several portraits, genres he developed while studying at the Scuola Libera del Disegno del Nudo. In his drawings, Osman reflects his background as a sculptor, by applying clear lines and shades on sculptural volumes. His works can be found in private collections, the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> Art in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the <Organization>Agriculture Museum</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the <Organization>Museum of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location> and the Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>."

"Ahmed Cherkaoui,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Ahmed-Cherkaoui.aspx</Address>
Ahmed Cherkaoui was one of the leading modernist painters of <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> art in the period after the country gained its independence in <Date>1956</Date>. Born in a small town, Boujad, located in the Chaouia plain, Cherkaoui descended, from his father&apos;s side, from &quot;a famous family of mystics&quot; called the &quot;Sufi brotherhood of the Cherkaoua.&quot; The brotherhood was founded in <Date>1566</Date> during the reign of the Saadian sultans. His mother was of Amazighi origin, belonging to the Zayanes tribe from the Middle Atlas. The tribe was known for women&apos;s traditionally made handcrafts and wool weaving.
Cherkaoui studied graphics at the École des Metiers d&apos;Art de <Location>Paris</Location> <Date>from 1956 to 1959</Date>, and continued his studies at the Aujame Atelier at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-<Organization>Arts</Organization> de <Location>Paris</Location> for one year. In 1961, during the political and cultural thaw following the death of Stalin, Cherkaoui moved to <Location>Warsaw</Location> where he studied at the <Organization>Academy of Fine Arts</Organization>. Later Cherkaoui returned to <Location>Paris</Location>, where he won a research grant from <Organization>UNESCO</Organization> to study signs and symbols in Amazighi art and Arab-Islamic calligraphy. During the early sixties, he held his first one-man show at the Atelier de Lucienne Thalheimer in <Location>Paris</Location> where he lived and worked.
Cherkaoui created large-scale abstract and symbolic canvases which negotiated an amalgam of references, ranging from Amazighi art, talismanic symbols to Roger Bissière, Paul Klee and Surrealism. The surface of these canvases are covered with burlap onto which Cherkaoui painted black-striped symbols crafted within an oval structure and laid at intervals with bright colors. The Maghreb, &quot;the place of the setting sun,&quot; and more specifically the Amazighi tradition of the bare geometric sign are all intrinsic to the artist. Since his young age, his fascination with signs stemmed from his curiosity about the shapes and meaning of his mother&apos;s tattoos. Later on, he embraced the teachings and philosophy of Paul Klee, who wrote, &quot;Man is not a completed product…We must…be open-minded…approach life like a child…of creation, of the creator&apos;s,&quot; and made them a guiding rule of his own spirit.
The desire to paint for Ahmed Cherkaoui is partially attributed to his interest in calligraphy and the motifs of popular talismans, and partly to his exposure to 20th century <Location>Western Modern</Location> art. Consequently, Cherkaoui&apos;s works reveal a concrete manifestation of a tangible interplay between tradition and modernity, negotiating both the aesthetic and abstract nature of signs and symbols which govern both Islamic art and new innovative techniques. However, Cherkaoui&apos;s resort to signs consists of far more than merely presenting their decorative function. He used a system of geometric signs and ciphers, including triangles, circles, lozenges, dots and broken and curved lines. These signs voice stories about a particular social system that are open to interpretation. As such, his creative artwork presented intriguing and visually complex forms which highlight his profound interest in national heritage.
In 1964, Cherkaoui held an exhibition at Jeanne Castel&apos;s Gallery in <Location>Paris</Location>, and other exhibitions in <Location>Rabat</Location>, <Location>Tangier</Location> and <Location>Casablanca</Location> in <Location>Morocco</Location>, where he explored and developed a personal modern style, he expressed in crude jute collages. After his collages, he went through a phase that he referred to as &quot;tachiste&quot; or formlessness, where he emphasized the value of color.
During the early sixties, his artwork depicted various forms drawn from outlines of tattoos, pottery, jewelry, weaving and motifs on handicraft ware, combining both bright and earth colors to highlight the cultural characteristics of his country of origin (al-Maghreb—&quot;sunset in the sea&quot;). While dark colors dominated his paintings before 1965, his colors afterwards became lighter and more lustrous with greater awareness of the use of space and additional media such as fiber, gouache and watercolor.
Cherkaoui&apos;s works received recognition early on as he won the bronze medal at the 10th &quot;Salon Interministériel&quot; in <Date>1962</Date> and took part regularly in the Salon de Mai in <Location>Paris</Location>. He participated in many solo exhibitions including his one-man show at the Ursula Girardon&apos;s Gallery in <Date>1962</Date> in <Location>Paris</Location>; and numerous collective exhibitions, including &quot;20 Peintres étrangers&quot; in the Parisian Musée de l&apos;Art Moderne in <Date>1963</Date>.
Cherkaoui taught drawing classes at the <Organization>Technical College</Organization> in <Location>Beaumont</Location>-sur-Oise. He was generally associated with a small group of painters in <Location>Casablanca</Location> including Houssein Tallal and Andre Elbaz although he was never part of the <Organization>Casablanca School</Organization>. Cherkaoui traveled frequently between <Location>Europe</Location> and <Location>North Africa</Location>, and died suddenly due to complications from an appendectomy in <Date>1967</Date> after coming back to <Location>Casablanca</Location>, <Location>Morocco</Location>.
After his death, his work was represented in a series of retrospective shows entitled Hommage à Cherkaoui organized at the Biennale de <Location>Paris</Location> and also at the Salon of Sacred Art in <Location>Paris</Location>; followed by the Biennale Exhibit of <Location>New Delhi</Location> in <Date>1968</Date> in <Location>India</Location>. His works were also featured at the interférences Poetes-Peintres group show at the Daniel Templon Gallery, one of Cherkaoui&apos;s watercolor works accompanying the poem &apos;talisman&apos; written by Jean Guichard Meili in <Location>Paris</Location> in <Date>1969</Date>.

In a first interview with Arab News Felemban about this exhibition he was quoted to have said something that seems to be expected of all <Origin>Saudi</Origin> artists: &quot;the techniques we acquired from <Location>Italy</Location> were merged to the <Origin>Saudi</Origin> spirit, its culture and heritage.&quot;
A week later in another interview he makes clear that such behaviour was because society was not ready to recieve them back from <Location>Italy</Location>. Out of necessity he became a teacher.

&quot;Our <Origin>Saudi</Origin> art has no identity, we are still looking for an identity. <Origin>Saudi</Origin> art needs to be shaped by having a society or a school to supply the basics.&quot;
In <Date>May 2008</Date> Felemban again with the <Organization><Origin>Italian</Origin> consulate</Organization> organized an exhibition, but now for 5 women artists. (<Date>2009</Date>).

He made it himself in the village where he was raised in the Al-Washim region and cut his own hair to make its brush. Don&apos;t ask when his work is finished. It never is. There is always more paint to be made. It is the creative impuls itself.
His art education was in schools in <Location>Riyadh</Location> when in his perception such education at the high end of society was better than in present times. His mind was further openend when from <Date>1974-1979</Date> he studied in <Location>Rome</Location>.

The result of this, the rock which went through his hands, mind, heart and fingers has been on show to the public in the <Location>Middle East</Location> and other countries around the globe at frequent exhibitions since <Date>1985</Date>. A large selection of his works can be seen on his own website. And this website is worth visiting for another reason. Ali Al-Tokhais is a professor of sculpture and shows with pride pictures of his students with their work.Al-Tokhais has said that the Arabic alphabet is a silent influence in his work that by itself is abstract. But the abstraction is taken away again by contemplation while the rock is revealing its new form or perhaps as an afterthought. So the works of rock find themselves entrusted with titles which carry meaning. And sometimes, as is probabaly the case with Penetration, the rock is trusted with the nation itself.

The drawings and sketch books included in Disorientation II were created during this important year when he both physically and intellectually journeyed back to the Arab world and began what would be a life-long fascination for, and investigation of, Arab culture, history and identity.By <Date>1978</Date> Jabri had settled in <Location>Amman</Location> where he lived until his death in <Date>2002</Date>. The richness of Arab culture and history inspired both Jabri’s art and his growing interest in the preservation of heritage sites and antiquities. He continued drawing and painting, while curating museum collections, participating in archaeological excavations, leading design and architecture projects at major antiquities sites, designing exhibitions and supervising other cultural heritage preservation projects. A large cache of previously unseen work, now conserved by the Ali <Organization>Jabri Human Heritage Foundation</Organization> in <Location>Amman</Location>, reflects the depth and diversity of his artistic oeuvre.

After graduation, while developing her painting, Riahi began to explore other media, resulting in a number of video and installation pieces and most recently, a series of works that fuse embroidery, photography and written text. The focus of her early works was her relationship with the environment, which she expressed as several series of self-portraits in a fanciful, metaphoric world. This body of work led to other series - still ongoing – based on famous fairytales which then Riahi re-narrates in her own way. She expanded this approach overtime and tried to pose more detailed questions about the society through these fantastical scenarios.
In her most recent installations, the artist focuses closely on the position of the women in her society, to whom she feels a profound connection. With these works, she continues to portray a metaphorical world, but now more directly and through the relationship between the selected photographs and <Origin>Iranian</Origin>-native embroidered flowers, descriptive texts of their symbolic meanings, and the final presentation of these three elements as functional tables. Arefeh has shown her works in different group exhibitions and film festivals in <Location>Tehran</Location>, <Location>Istanbul</Location>, <Location>Pakistan</Location>, <Location>Dubai</Location>, <Location>Brazil</Location> and <Location>The Netherlands</Location>.

The repetition of images and the quasi-religious imagery he employs give the series the air of devotional shrines whilst the brightly colored, elaborate, repetitive arrangements are reminiscent both of Henri Matisse&apos;s decorative patterning as well as Faulwell&apos;s own <Origin>Iranian</Origin>/Islamic tradition of geometric design.

In many ways, Sabri&apos;s career mirrors that of his contemporaries. He was educated in the arts abroad and his works show a blending of western art techniques with an <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> essence. The artist is well-known for his pleasing representations of the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> countryside. Done with a subtle skill, Sabri&apos;s canvases exhibit the beauty of the landscape and the customs of its inhabitants.    
Sabri completed his early education at the <Location>Dar</Location> al-Mualimin or the &quot;<Organization>House</Organization> of Teachers&quot; in <Location>Baghdad</Location> in <Date>1934</Date>. He then went on to teach at local schools. Like other artists of his generation, Sabri won a government-sponsored scholarship to pursue the arts in <Location>Europe</Location>. He travelled to <Location>Rome</Location> to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in <Date>1937</Date>, but was forced to return home at the outbreak of World War II. During the years <Date>between 1940 and 1944</Date>, Sabri was employed at the <Organization>Department of Antiquities</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location>. In 1946, Sabri was again presented with the opportunity to study art abroad and finished his BFA in <Location>London</Location> at <Organization>Goldsmiths College</Organization> and the <Organization>Slade School</Organization>. After graduating in <Date>1950</Date>, he held a professorship at the <Organization>Institute of Fine Art</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location>, among other institutions.

Sabri was one of the pioneer artists to be showcased at the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> artist pavilion during the 1931 Industrial and Agricultural Fair in <Location>Baghdad</Location>. This was a watershed exhibition for Atta Sabri and his colleagues as it exposed the public to contemporary <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> art for the first time. Sabri also participated in the 1950 First <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> <Organization>Art</Organization> Show in <Location>London</Location>. In <Date>1973</Date>, the painter was invited by the <Origin>German</Origin> university, <Organization>Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg</Organization>, to contribute to their craft conference. Subsequently, Sabri contributed to several exhibitions at the <Organization>National Museum</Organization> of Modern <Organization>Art</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location>, especially <Date>between 1977 and 1980</Date>. In <Date>1979</Date> the museum hosted a major retrospective of Sabri&apos;s work.
The painter&apos;s style remained fairly consistent with a blending of realist and impressionistic qualities. The quiet, blooming crannies in and around <Location>Baghdad</Location> were Sabri&apos;s favored subjects. He also painted sweeping vistas that often contrasts a rocky outcrop with a smooth valley. He rarely focused on individuals, unless composing a portrait. Instead, he centered his canvases on the qualities of the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> environment varying his brushstrokes to reflect movement in the scenery.
When Sabri does focus on human activity the scenes are usually composed as windows into timeless traditions. The viewer stands aloof while passively watching a group of figures interact. Whether it is a cluster of women bathing or musicians playing, a sense of local custom is conveyed through distinctive dress and a ritualized treatment of the portrayed event. There is an overall simplicity and serenity in Sabri&apos;s work that can be seen in a number of artists from his generation who were seeking to engage the natural aesthetics of their homeland. 
A number of Atta Sabri&apos;s pieces, including his lively rendering of musicians and dancers, were looted from the <Organization>National Museum</Organization> of Modern <Organization>Art</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location>. The artist&apos;s son Salam Atta Sabri, the director of the museum and an artist in his own right, has dedicated himself to raising awareness of the fate of these works and is working towards their recovery.

The public projects of Ayşe Erkmen nearly always reflect her concerns with the physical, cultural and social landscapes in which she works.
Erkmen&apos;s work often takes the form of interventions in a space that are sometimes so subtle and minimal as to be almost unnoticed. For the 9th <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization> she created Sindi Tamaam / Alright Now (<Date>2009</Date>), a geometrically ‘corrected’ room within a room, where the walls and ceiling of an exhibition space were rebuilt to reflect the slope of the ramp that leads viewers through the museum.

Basmah Felemban (<Date>1993</Date>) is a graphic designer with the slightly loose touch that betrays the real artist. She landed her work Jeem in the <Organization>British Museum</Organization> at a sideshow to the <Date>2012</Date> Hajj exhibition and on her blog in <Date>December 2011</Date> she was kind enough to allow the world a sneak preview of &apos;the making of Jeem&apos; showing us how she wrestled with stencils to separate light and darkness on an octangular piece of wood, creating and image which looks like at least two works of art, intimately attached to each other for a fate of eternal friction. She mentioned online her interest in Islamic art and Jeem reflects exactly that, but even more so the work left us with the impression that the very best things might well happen outside the greater plan of known geometry. The people she most admires in the field of art? Leonardo da Vinci and Banksy. Felemban finished highschool in <Date>2011</Date> and describes herself now, for those who twitter, as an &apos;amateur artist.&apos; An opinion with which we are inclined to strongly disagree, if not Da Vinci would have said exactly the same about himself. In her frequent writing on blogs she takes an interest in what other artists do and make. Her frank contribution &apos;Let the walls speak&apos; for pan-arabic Mashallah News reported on the growth of street art in her country and made an interesting read. (<Date>2012</Date>) ***After writing the above, the artist informed us of the concept of Jeem, which is the first letter of both &apos;janna&apos; (heaven) and &apos;jaheem&apos; (hell). The artist based the design on each of the two squares in this octangular work on one of these words using the geometric kufi typeface creating a &apos;complex contrast&apos; as they overlap. We would say she delivered her concept exactly right and trusted chance to help her deliver. (<Date>2012</Date>)

Rather than a sculptor, installation artist or ceramicist, engaged in some mystic relationship with her materials, Bita Fayyazi is an artist working in a performative and markedly social practice.
Beginning in <Date>the mid-1990s</Date>, Fayyazi’s artistic interventions challenged the official definitions of art that were often circulated in <Location>Tehran</Location> at that time. Fayyazi struggled to show her work amid an atmosphere of stuffy traditionalism, academicism, and the influx of ‘90s conceptual art from abroad. She entered 2,000 ceramic cockroaches into <Location>Tehran</Location>’s 6th Biennial of Contemporary Ceramic Art, despite an attempt by several members of the committee to oust her work from the show. She cast and fired terracotta dogs (‘Road Kill’, <Date>1998</Date>), modelled on dead dogs found on the highways in <Location>Tehran</Location>, and then placed her creations onto streets around the city, much to the consternation of onlookers."

"César Gemayel,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Cesar-Gemayel.aspx</Address>
Born in the village of &apos;Ain al-Touffaha, near Bikfaya, Gemayel originally sought to continue in the family business by studying pharmacology at the <Organization><Origin>American</Origin> University of Beirut</Organization>. While a student, Gemayel apprenticed in the atelier of the <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> painter Khalil Saleeby (<Date>1870 - 1928</Date>), well known for his portraits and nudes painted with an Impressionist focus on light. In 1927, Gemayel traveled to <Location>Paris</Location> for three years to continue his artistic development at the Academie Julien. During this period, Gemayel developed an admiration for the work of the Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir (<Date>1841 - 1919</Date>).
In 1930, Gemayel returned to <Location>Beirut</Location> and dedicated himself to his art. In addition to a prolific body of work on paper, Gemayel made substantial contributions to the development in <Location>Lebanon</Location> of an infrastructure for the visual arts, most notably as a founding member of the <Organization>Committee of Friends</Organization> of the National Museums and Archaeological Sites (est. 1923) and through his teaching at L&apos;Académie <Origin>Libanaise</Origin> des Beaux-Arts (ALBA, est. 1937), where he served as a founding faculty member and at one time director of the <Organization>department of Art</Organization> and <Organization>Architecture</Organization>, established in <Date>1943</Date>.
Throughout his career, Gemayel exhibited abroad and in <Location>Lebanon</Location>, showing regularly at the <Organization>Parliament</Organization> and the <Organization>UNESCO</Organization> building in <Location>Beirut</Location>. He received First Prize at the Exposition Coloniale in <Location>Paris</Location> in <Date>1930</Date> and was later presented with the <Organization><Origin>Lebanese</Origin> National</Organization> Order of the Cedar. Subsequent to his premature death due to a heart attack in <Date>1958</Date>, the <Organization>Sursock Museum</Organization> in <Location>Beirut</Location> honored Gemayel&apos;s memory at the 1964 Salon d&apos;Automne."

"Daoud Corm,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Daoud-Corm.aspx</Address>
Born in Ghosta in <Location>Mount</Location> <Location>Lebanon</Location>, Corm and his family resettled soon afterwards in his mother&apos;s home village of <Location>Ghazir</Location>. His beginnings as an artist can be dated back to 1861, when two <Origin>Italian</Origin> Jesuit priests discovered Corm&apos;s drawings on some rocks. Mistaking the young boy&apos;s depictions of birds for three-dimensional reality, the priests were mesmerized by Corm&apos;s natural talent and offered him a position teaching drawing at the local Jesuit missionary school in exchange for <Origin>Italian</Origin> language lessons. After nearly a decade teaching in the school, sometime in <Date>the late 1860s</Date> Corm sold several paintings to the <Organization>Maronite Church</Organization> in <Location>Mount</Location> <Location>Lebanon</Location> to pay for a ticket to <Location>Rome</Location> to study at the Accademia di San Luca under artist Roberto Bompiani.
In 1878, Corm chose to settle in <Location>Beirut</Location>. Then part of the Ottoman Empire, the city had undergone radical transformations over the <Date>previous decade</Date> as it emerged as a commercial, political, and cultural hub in the region. In addition to a population surge following the 1860 civil war in <Location>Mount</Location> <Location>Lebanon</Location>, <Location>Beirut</Location> had grown substantially due to a number of infrastructural projects jointly sponsored by the Ottoman and European governments. In turn, throughout the nineteenth century, a host of families had migrated to <Location>Beirut</Location> from <Location>Aleppo</Location>, <Location>Damascus</Location>, <Location>Tripoli</Location>, Acre, Sidon and <Location>Mount Lebanon</Location> to join a growing community of Damascene merchant families. It was from this newly emerging upwardly mobile urban class of merchants, intellectuals, and politicians—known historically as members of al-nahda—that Corm would cultivate a patron base.
Working mainly in oil on canvas, along with pastel on paper, Corm depicted <Location>Beirut</Location>&apos;s elite in his signature style: a pared down, formal, three-quarter length portrait against a dark background with an attention to the individual&apos;s social and professional standing. In many ways, Corm&apos;s work drew on conventions for portraiture previously established both in oil painting and photography, a medium popular among elite at the time. Perhaps Corm&apos;s two most recognized portraits are those of Bustros al-Bustani (<Date>1894</Date>) and Pope Pius IX (early 1870s), which served as Corm&apos;s calling card.
Corm&apos;s patrons were not limited to <Location>Beirut</Location> and <Location>Mount Lebanon</Location>. Before establishing his atelier in <Location>Beirut</Location>, Corm spent a period of time in <Location>Belgium</Location> after being commissioned by Leopold II to paint portraits of the Royal Family of <Location>Belgium</Location>. In 1887, he traveled to Alexandria to capture with his brush the leading governors there as well as members of the nobility. In 1894, the Khedive Abbas II invited Corm again to <Location>Egypt</Location> to paint the ruler&apos;s portrait.
In addition to his portraits, Corm created a substantial body of religious works, the majority of which were commissioned by the <Organization>Maronite Church</Organization> and many of which remain in churches throughout <Location>Mount Lebanon</Location>. In fact, before Corm, oil painting was limited to clerics in the church, many of whom had been trained by <Origin>Italian</Origin> missionaries and clerics at the <Organization>Maronite College of Rome</Organization>, established in <Date>1584</Date> to strengthen ties between the <Location>Vatican</Location> and the region&apos;s Christian communities. These cleric-painters, as they have come to be known, include Musa Dib (d.1826), who studied at the <Organization>Maronite College of Rome</Organization>, and his nephew Kan&apos;an Dib (d. 1873), who along with Corm trained with Constantin Giusti, an <Origin>Italian</Origin> painter who had come to <Location>Mount Lebanon</Location> with the Jesuit missionaries in <Date>1831</Date>. Thus, although Corm&apos;s academic style may have been outdated in <Location>Europe</Location>, his historical significance lies in his ability to forge a local market for oil portraits, previously reserved for religious figures. Moreover, the presence of still life, landscapes, and genre scenes within his oeuvre suggests an on spec market for works on canvas and paper.
In 1912, Corm expanded his artistic enterprise and its public appeal when he opened Maison d&apos;Art, an art supply store centrally located near <Location>Beirut</Location>&apos;s post office. The store&apos;s commercial success indicated a growing public interest not only in art viewing but also in art making.
Corm exhibited his work abroad in <Location>Egypt</Location> and <Location>Europe</Location>, most notably at the 1889 <Location>Versailles</Location> Exhibition in <Location>France</Location> and at the 1900 <Location>Paris</Location> Exhibition, where he received the Prize of Honor of Excellence. Additional recognition of his career includes receipt of the <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> Order of Merit and the Ottoman Medal of Glory. Corm died in <Date>1930</Date>."

"Dia Aziz Dia ,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-diaazizdia.html</Address>
Dia Aziz Dia is a painter and sculptor from <Location>Jeddah</Location> who was one of the first to attend the academy of fine arts in <Location>Rome</Location> and resisted being for ever a full time teacher and ignoring the human face and the natural environment as a source of inspiration. 
In his own clever words on his website he explains he thought art an attempt to reveal the secret that was hidden behind appearance:
&quot;Thus, he constantly tried to depict the human face because he considered it the key to understanding the person and a way to question his or her secrets and inherent potential. This could be carried out through capturing the details of the face in a process that combined drawing and erasing. It resulted in an abstract face, not in the usual sense of abstraction, but in the sense of denying the details that were not relevant to the notion that the artist wanted to capture. The artist focused only on the meaningful fragments, which were the expression of the world that he was trying to depict.&quot;
Hence the editors of this dictionary come to the conclusion that the excellent painting to the left by Diaz in the best tradtition of the <Origin>Italian</Origin> renaissance is not H.M. King Faisal but an abstraction of Diaz. (<Date>2008</Date>).

"Djamel Kokene,http://nadour.org/artists/djamel-kokene/</Address>
Within his work, Djamel Kokene explores the tensions between language, thought and representation. Thus, he stages the written word it in many of his works, sometimes associated with objects, always in a strong conceptual stance. By drawing themes from the heart of contemporary society, the artist also readily deals with notions of identity, nationality and community, challenging them with the notions of nomadism and displacement.
Born in Ain El Hamman in <Location>Algeria</Location> in <Date>1968</Date>, Djamel Kokene has been living in <Location>France</Location> since <Date>1978</Date>.He graduated in Fine Arts, Philosophy and Aesthetics (with a cinema specialisation), and Hypermedia - New technologies (MFA, University <Location>Paris</Location> 8 - St Denis). He also attended classes at the Ecole Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in <Location>Paris</Location>.
Whilst reflecting the artistic practices, the question of the modes of production and teaching of art, from the beginning of his artistic activity the artist came up with various devices and concepts having a strong evolutionary and mobile dimension: thus since <Date>2000</Date>, he has been developing the concept of “Trainee -Artist” as well as “<Organization>Mobile-School</Organization>”, successively activated in <Location>Algiers</Location>, Bourges and <Location>Cairo</Location>.
In <Date>2002</Date>, he initiated the collective structure Laplateforme, a mobile laboratory for reflection and research on contemporary artistic creation of the <Location>Mediterranean</Location> area, willing to escape the NORTH-SOUTH authority for a dynamics open to the world. In <Date>2006</Date> he started publishing &quot;Checkpoint&quot;, a trilingual <Origin>French</Origin>-<Origin>English</Origin>-Arabic magazine on art and contemporary thinking.
Very recently, Djamel Kokene presented Nous at the Biennial of contemporary art in <Location>Rennes</Location>,&quot; Ce qui vient&quot; in <Date>2010</Date>. He has taken part in La Force de l’Art 02, the contemporary art Triennale in <Date>2009</Date> in <Location>Paris</Location> as well as &quot;Le porte del Mediterraneo&quot; (doors of the <Location>Mediterranean</Location>) at the Palazzo del Piozzo Rivoli in <Location>Turin</Location> in <Date>2008</Date>.

"Driss Ouadahi,http://www.lawrieshabibi.com/artists/42-driss-ouadahi/overview/</Address>
Driss Ouadahi takes as his subject matter the built environment of urban alienation - sterile modernist public housing developments, wire netting and underground passageways. Ouadahi paints works of paradoxical beauty using this stark urbanism as his springboard.
Currently Ouadahi works in three milieu- landscapes, fences and underpasses. Persistent in each are his core concerns of geometric abstraction, transparency and the implication of the veil.
His large formal landscapes are montages of spaces and places he knows, with human-scale details often omitted. His labyrinthine layering of planes creates space and perspective that is both familiar and confusing. The accuracy Ouadahi&apos;s execution belies the fragility of the structures he paints. Ouadahi&apos;s fences recall the wire-netting common in the metropolitan suburbs of <Location>France</Location> and <Location>Algeria</Location>. They delimit zones into which entrance is not permitted and demarcate privileged zones. Ouadahi&apos;s underpasses are the most illusionistic and are based on actual subways in <Location>Germany</Location>.
Born in <Location>Casablanca</Location>, <Location>Morocco</Location>, of <Origin>Algerian</Origin> parents in <Date>1959</Date>, Driss Ouadahi grew up in <Location>Algeria</Location>.

"Fahd Al-Khalif,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-fahdalkhalif.html</Address>
Fahd Al-Khalif (<Date>1972</Date>) is a most generous of painters dealing with mostly the figurative world with all insights of Parisien abstraction from Cezanne to Matisse. And in this you can&apos;t help noticing how often he uses light blue, actually seems to adore the colour or to find it necessary. Al-Khalif is a true colorist not just painting the world but laying a reef of paintings over <Location>Jeddah</Location> as if he regrets that coral and fishes were left to the sea and below its surface and birds to the sky. As a master of art education and head of such education in <Location>north Jeddah</Location> his proficiency in handling oils and perhaps acrylic paint should be judged self evident, but surprising is how many paintings he shows in his presentation on facebook. They number hundreds and with consistency of vision and of life, sometimes changing the subject to calligraphy or horses. Occasionally Al-Khalif explores a naïve realism or his usual abstract style with more subdued colours. Some of his works appear to be wallpaintings by themselves or to have been assembled with square canvasses brought together to match. All these are styles and themes not unusual in the country, but Al-Khalif easily convinces as being master of any caravan.Al-Khalif mentiones many exhibitions in <Location>Jeddah</Location> and many in countries in <Location>Europe</Location> representing his country. Out of hundreds of his paintings I selected a few special images, which perhaps don&apos;t give an idea of his most frequent themes and style, but which celebrate the diversity and richness of <Location>Jeddah</Location> life as a result of its position as port to <Location>Makkah</Location>.

"Fahrelnissa Zeid,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Fahrelnissa-Zeid.aspx</Address>
Born into a prominent Ottoman family with an avid love for books and art, Fahrelnissa Zeid was exposed since her birth to her brother&apos;s brushstrokes and the oil paintings of her mother, Sara Ismet Hanim, on silk clothes hanging on the walls of her home. Zeid began painting in her early childhood and drawing portraits at the age of twelve. Her father, Mohammad Shakir Pasha, was a diplomat, general, photographer and historian. Zeid along with many members of her family were considered models of Ottoman intellectualism.
Zeid was among the first women to attend the <Organization>Academy of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Istanbul</Location> in <Date>1920</Date>, where she studied under the <Origin>Turkish</Origin> painter Namik Ismail. In 1928, she travelled to <Location>Paris</Location> and trained in the studio of Stahlbach and Roger Bissière at the Académie Ranson.
Throughout her career, Zeid participated in almost 50 exhibitions in <Location>Europe</Location>, <Location>U.S.A.</Location> and the <Location>Middle East</Location>. Her <Location>New York</Location> debut came in <Date>1950</Date> when she exhibited a series of large abstract canvases at the Hugo Gallery followed later on by numerous international shows (See Exhibitions below).

"Faiq Hassan,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Faiq-Hassan-Alawi-al-Janabi.aspx</Address>
aiq Hassan (<Date>1914 - 1992</Date>) is often referred to as the father of <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> modern art.  During his artistic career he took on many roles within the burgeoning <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> art scene, including educator and founder. In the crucial decades of <Date>the 1940s</Date> and 50s, Hassan was devoted to the creation of an art form that would express the growing feelings of national pride amongst <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> citizens. He was also interested in developing his own technical skill and that of his students. In later decades, Hassan would remain a leading artist in <Location>Iraq</Location> and his artistic legacy continues to be a powerful influence.
Born in <Location>Baghdad</Location> in <Date>1914</Date>, Hassan remembers his childhood as a series of art experiments, as he would master one media and move on to the next. A typical experiment involved mud from the <Location>Tigris River</Location> sculpted in the shape of horses and people. He did not consider himself bright in the traditional sense as he neglected his schoolwork. His talent for art-making, however, developed with ease and he was encouraged by his teachers. One teacher in particular, the artist Muhammad Khidir, became Hassan&apos;s mentor and artistic example. He considered Khidir a master of color subtleties, whose work would later point the way for Hassan&apos;s own investigations into color theory.
Hassan&apos;s artistic aptitude was awarded in <Date>1933</Date> when he became the second recipient of a government-funded scholarship to study art in <Location>Europe</Location>. He travelled to <Location>France</Location> and enrolled at the Ècole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. In <Location>Paris</Location>, Hassan had a fairly traditional education in the arts. He participated in art history and studio classes while completing art projects based on copying master works. Hassan was also introduced to important figures of European modernism. He was especially impressed with artists like Matisse and Delacroix, paying specific attention to their use of color. Like many art students, Hassan spent his years in <Location>Paris</Location> synthesizing aspects of his education and life experiences into a workable artistic practice. Thus, these were days of exploration and a growing awareness of the international art scene.
Hassan returned to <Location>Baghdad</Location> after receiving his degree in <Date>1938</Date>. Soon after, he accepted a position at the <Organization>Institute of Fine Art</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location> as the director of the <Organization>Department of Painting</Organization> and <Organization>Sculpture</Organization>. During his tenure at the institute, which continued until 1962, Hassan introduced courses based on Western painting techniques, as well as classes for the study of Islamic and Arab folk arts, like pottery and metalwork. He also went to great lengths to develop the efficacy of the department by training future teachers and procuring basic art supplies and gypsum models. In conjunction with his job as an administrator, Hassan was an involved teacher. He taught courses on color theory, perspective, anatomy, and design, as well as classes in art history. He encouraged his students to search their local surroundings for inspiration while honing their technical skills. Hassan took student development as a personal responsibility and made it his duty to oversee the first generation of artists to graduate from the institute. Over the <Date>next decade</Date>, the institute became the center of artistic activity and Hassan&apos;s reputation as a leading figure in <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> art education was firmly established.

"Faisal Samra,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-faisalsamra.html</Address>
Faisal Samra moves in front of a camera recording in black and white. We do not recognize him and only see a man&apos;s upper body from behind with a white sheet pulled over it. His face is and will remain hidden througout the performance. He nevertheless turns to face his viewers and picks up the loose ends of the sheet and starts winding them around his head. This goes on for a while with both or changing hands. When the sheet is all wrapped around the head and shoulders, he doesn&apos;t stop but continues only to wrap things differently and more firmly, sometimes passing stages that look like he has a bird&apos;s beak or is a severly wounded hospital patient. After a while he simply walks away with the sheet still in place. Such is the video installation Samra presents on his website as Distorted Reality (improvisation).
Samra believes he is arming people against the beautified &apos;made-up images&apos; which are produced by ad-men and news editors to flatter and deceive us into making the wrong choices. He thinks these image producers wage a ruthless war on us and on many levels, but he has said in an interview that it was the role of the media in justifying the actual &apos;War on Terror&apos; that made up his mind to start the body of work that is Distorted Reality. He uses digital photography, computer graphics and video to record these improvised and mostly very similar performances. They are also presented in a photographic format as a triptych. The cloth or cloths may be more colourful and he may add a number of props, but they all tell of a struggle with images we hold close to our heads. A skinned lamb appears in one of them. He has been quoted as saying that this was a memory from watching a lamb being slaughtered with Eid Al-Adha when he was only four years old and starting to draw. Samra&apos;s own distorted realities are not about beautifying the worse but perhaps a better which is to question our resistance against images. 
Faisal Samra (<Date>1956</Date>) was born and lives in <Location>Bahrain</Location>. He has the <Origin>Saudi Arabian</Origin> nationality and has worked in <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location> for a number of years after graduating with honours from the <Organization>Ecole National</Organization> Superieure des Beaux Arts in <Location>Paris</Location> in <Date>1980</Date>. He has been a fine arts and graphics consultant with the <Organization>Institut du Monde Arabe</Organization>. He has explored Islamic design in Marocco and lived and worked in <Location>Lebanon</Location> and <Location>Jordan</Location>. He ventured upon his DistortedRealities after having been artist in residence (<Date>2005</Date>) at the <Organization>Cité International</Organization> des Arts in <Location>Paris</Location>. Earlier work of Samra involved among other things canvas &apos;released&apos; from the frame and wrapped around wire mesh. This older work is included in the Al-Mansouria foundation collection.

"Farid Belkahia,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Farid-Belkahia.aspx</Address>
One of the foremost modernist artists in <Location>Morocco</Location>, Farid Belkahia began his training at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts of <Location>Paris</Location> <Date>from 1954 to 1959</Date>. He continued his studies in <Location>Prague</Location> until returning to <Location>Morocco</Location> in <Date>1962</Date> to become director of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in <Location>Casablanca</Location>, a position he retained until <Date>1974</Date>. Belkahia turned away from oil painting and easels in <Date>the early 1960s</Date> and began working primarily with large-scale hammered copper. While retaining multiple dimensions, the copper was meant to be hung on walls and was used to create bas-reliefs. Since <Date>the mid-1970s</Date>, Belkahia is best known for the work he has done with leather, which he treats using traditional techniques and stretches over shaped supports. He then paints the leather with naturally occurring dyes such as henna.
The process of the work on both copper and leather is for Belkahia an important aspect of the creation of his art, and his work typically highlights not just the organic shapes that make up the content of the work, but the texture and dimensionality of the materials themselves. He has a consistent and carefully theorized taxonomy of symbols, shapes, and materials that resurface throughout his oeuvre. Belkahia&apos;s work typically uses sinuous, organic shapes that recall bodies or corporality. Many of his works use triangles, arrows, and hands, and often involve questions of sexuality. He often employs Tifinagh letters from the Amazigh alphabet and symbols culled from traditional visual culture within <Location>Morocco</Location>, derived from rugs, tattoos, and architecture. Part of the interest of his work, however, is the way in which these symbols are re-constituted and re-imagined to become an integral part of his modernist visual vocabulary.
Belkahia was an active voice in the debates around post-colonial artistic modernism in <Location>Morocco</Location>, and contributed to   the leftist cultural and intellectual journal Souffles when it first came out. For Belkahia, using the cultural heritage of <Location>Morocco</Location> in his shapes, materials, and technique was a way of rooting international modernism within the local context. Under his leadership, the <Location>Casablanca</Location> Ecole des Beaux-Arts became known for advancing a pedagogy that turned away from the inherited <Origin>French</Origin> model of easel paintings and still lifes, instead highlighting <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> visual culture and architecture. The pedagogy of the art school was closely linked to the artists&apos; broader activities. With the artists Mohammed Melehi and Mohammed Chebaa (both of whom taught at the school), he formed the <Location>Casablanca</Location> group that first exhibited together in <Location>Rabat</Location> in <Date>1966</Date>. In 1969, these artists along with three other professors from the school organized the &quot;exposition manifeste&quot; in Djemaa al-Fna in <Location>Marrakech</Location>, an open-air exhibition that sought direct contact with a larger public outside of official arts spaces. Later that same year, a similar exhibition was held in the Place du 16 Novembre in <Location>Casablanca</Location>.
Belkahia has had multiple personal exhibitions at major art venues in <Location>Morocco</Location>, including the national gallery, Galerie Bab Rouah, in <Location>Rabat</Location>, the Galerie L&apos;Atelier in <Location>Rabat</Location>, the Cultural Moussem of Asilah, the <Organization>Batha Museum of Fes</Organization>, and the Galerie Delacroix in <Location>Tangier</Location>. He has also had international solo exhibitions including those at <Organization>Darat al Funun (Amman)</Organization> and the Musée d&apos;Art Moderne et Contemporain (<Location>Nice</Location>). His work was represented in  major early exhibitions of <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> modern art, including &quot;<Date>2000</Date> ans d&apos;art au <Location>Maroc</Location>&quot; (Galerie Charpentier, <Location>Paris</Location>) and the 1963 <Organization>Rencontre International</Organization> in <Location>Rabat</Location>, as well as the <Location>Paris</Location> Biennale (1959 and 1961), the Festival of Negro Arts in <Location>Dakar</Location> (<Date>1966</Date>), the Panafrican Festival in <Location>Algiers</Location> (<Date>1967</Date>), and the First Arab Biennial in <Location>Baghdad</Location> (<Date>1974</Date>). More recently, his art was included in the exhibitions &quot;Présences artistiques du <Location>Maroc</Location>&quot; (Maison de la Culture, <Location>Grenoble</Location>, <Date>1985</Date>), &quot;Quatre peintures du <Location>Maroc</Location>&quot; (<Organization>Institut du Monde Arabe</Organization>, <Location>Paris</Location>, <Date>1991</Date>), &quot;Interventions&quot; (Mathaf, <Date>2009</Date>), and at the <Organization>Museum of Modern Art</Organization> (Johannesberg), the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (<Location>Berlin</Location>), and the Biennales of <Location>Venice</Location> and <Location>Lyon</Location>.

"Fayçal Baghriche ,http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/fayal-baghriche</Address> 
Born in <Location>Algeria</Location> in <Date>1972</Date>, <Location>Paris</Location>-based artist Fayçal Baghriche grew up navigating between Arab and Western cultures, forming his artistic perspective characterized by the blurring of distinct cultural lenses. By illuminating the simplicity of movement and modifying image fundamentals, his craft creates a body of works that challenges the frameworks of society.
Baghriche&apos;s performances, installations and photographs emulate scenes from daily life, illuminating the stereotypes of both human conduct and expression. He introduces slight discrepancies to unveil the instinctive nature of language and behavior, distancing what is considered an ordinary reality. Calling upon poetry and humor, the artist shapes his practice by embodying a precise state of mind, which he aims at the stimulation of critical thought.
Baghriche received a Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> diploma from <Organization>La Villa Arson</Organization>, <Location>Nice</Location>, a B.A. in Dramatic <Organization>Arts</Organization> from Sophia Antipolis, <Location>Nice</Location>, and an MA in Multimedia Creation from the <Organization>National School of Fine Arts</Organization>, <Location>Paris</Location>.

"Gamal el-Sigini,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Gamal-el-Sigini.aspx</Address>
Gamal el-Sigini was a sculptor and medalist born in the neighborhood of Bab al-Shaariya in <Location>Cairo</Location>. He grew up near the Khan al-Khalili market and was impressed as a child by the craftsmanship of the metalworkers and goldsmiths established in this area. He joined the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> in <Date>1933</Date>, where he studied under the <Location>Saint Petersburg</Location> born <Origin>Swedish</Origin> sculptor Boris Frödman-Cluzel (<Date>1878 - 1959</Date>). In 1937, el-Sigini won the Mahmoud Moukhtar Prize for sculpture, which was created by intellectual and feminist Huda Shaarawi in <Date>1935</Date> to commemorate the death of the renowned sculptor, Mahmoud Mokhtar (<Date>1891 - 1934</Date>). El-Sigini graduated in <Date>1938</Date>, and in <Date>1945</Date> founded the Group Sawt al-Fannān (The Voice of the Artist) that promoted young <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> artists and inspired the art critic Muhammad Sidqi al-Gabakhangi to establish a monthly art review with the same name.
El-Sigini traveled to <Location>Paris</Location> at his own expense and discovered the works of Rodin, Brancusi, Bourdelle and Maillol. In Egypt, he was a member of the <Organization>Group of Modern Art</Organization> founded in <Date>1947</Date> with his contemporaries; Hamed Owais, Gazbia Sirry, Zeinab Abdel Hamid, Salah Yousri and Youssef Sida. The same year, el-Sigini received a scholarship to pursue his studies in metalwork and sculpture in <Location>Rome</Location>. When he returned to <Location>Egypt</Location> in <Date>1951</Date>, he established his studio in the neighborhood of Zamalek and was appointed as a professor of sculpture at the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>. In 1958, he moved to Alexandria to head the department of sculpture at the <Organization>Faculty of Fine Arts</Organization> just after its creation by sculptor Ahmad Osman (<Date>1907 - 1970</Date>). El-Sigini left this post in <Date>1964</Date>, when he was named director of the section of sculpture at the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>. In 1969, because his works and those of his contemporaries were not commissioned for public spaces, he threw a number of his sculptures into the <Location>Nile</Location> to express his frustration. El-Sigini traveled to <Location>Spain</Location> for his last exhibition at the Center for <Location>Mediterranean</Location> Studies in <Location>Barcelona</Location>, where he died in <Date>November 1977</Date> at the age of sixty.
Gamal el-Sigini produced numerous works, using a diversity of materials, such as bronze, stone, copper, wood and leather. He developed an original technique of hammered red copper for executing low-reliefs inspired by ancient <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> art. From the 1950&apos;s, he sculpted social realist works dealing with intensely idealistic and patriotic themes. Although the message of his works was often political, el-Sigini created a poetic style characterized by the introduction of symbols, such as the dove or the snake, as well as his own calligraphy using the signs of an imaginary language. He sculpted allegorical reliefs of several places in <Location>Egypt</Location>, such as the <Location>Nile</Location>, Alexandria or <Location>Cairo</Location>, and often interpreted the image of motherhood as a representation of his homeland.
A recurrent subject in his work used as a symbol of <Location>Egypt</Location> is the carūsa, a bridal sugar-doll traditionally sold on the occasion of the celebration of the birth of the Prophet (mawlid al-nabawī). After the defeat of the Six-Day War in <Date>1967</Date>, el-Sigini, like many artists of his generation, expressed his disillusion and despair in his work. He conveyed this through the figure of a mutilated or hanged carūsa. El-Sigini produced several statues of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> public figures and in <Date>1958</Date>, won the governmental competition for the monument of the poet Ahmad Shawqi (<Date>1868 - 1932</Date>) to be placed in the gardens of the Villa Borghese in <Location>Rome</Location>. Two copies of this sculpture stand <Date>today</Date> in <Location>Cairo</Location> in front of the poet&apos;s Museum and inside the <Organization>Opera</Organization> <Organization>House</Organization>.
Besides being a sculptor, el-Sigini was a talented medalist and produced numerous medals in copper, silver and gold for various official occasions, such as the medals of the Alexandria Biennale from 1955 until the end of the <Date>1970</Date>&apos;s. He also designed projects for monuments, such as the reliefs for the monument of the Unknown Soldiers in Port Saïd and a monument of the <Date>October</Date> Victory, which was intended to be placed at the entrance of the <Location>Suez Canal</Location> but was finally not executed. El-Sigini is the author of a series of paintings inspired by rural life, sail boats and the figure of the carūsa. His works can be seen at the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> <Organization>Art</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the <Organization>Opera</Organization> <Organization>House</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the gardens of the Villa Borghese in <Location>Rome</Location>, as well as in the Mathaf <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>.

"Georges Daoud Corm,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Georges-Corm-1.aspx</Address>
George Daoud Corm was a distinguished painter and francophone poet and writer. In both his artwork and writings, Corm expressed a dedication to the classical tradition of European humanism and Christian ethics.
The son of painter Daoud Corm, Georges D. Corm was born into an artistic family and expressed an equal interest in painting and writing. Although he published his first poem in <Date>1915</Date>, Corm eventually chose to train as a professional visual artist, attending the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-<Organization>Arts</Organization> <Date>from 1919 to 1921</Date>. Upon his return to <Location>Beirut</Location>, Corm received immediate recognition for his paintings, having been honored with the Gold Medal at the 1921 <Location>Beirut</Location> Exhibition Fair. A year later, he won a competition for his proposal for the <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> Medal of Merit.
Devoted to <Location>Lebanon</Location> and its cultural enrichment as a nascent nation, Corm worked diligently to promote the arts. He served as a founding member of the committee for the <Organization>Museum of Antiquities</Organization> (<Date>1922 - 1928</Date>), jury member for both the <Organization><Origin>Lebanese</Origin> National</Organization> Conservatory of <Organization>Music and Committee</Organization> for the <Organization><Origin>Lebanese</Origin> National</Organization> Anthem, and as secretary for the 1926 International Archeological <Organization>Congress</Organization> in <Location>Beirut</Location>.
In 1928, with his marriage to Marie Bekhit, Corm left <Location>Beirut</Location> to live for a period of time in <Location>Egypt</Location>, first in <Location>Alexandria</Location> and later Cairo. Active in the <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> art scene, Corm helped establish in <Date>1934</Date> the &quot;Atelier,&quot; a collective dedicated to the promotion of arts and letters.
Corm and Marie returned in <Date>1956</Date> to <Location>Beirut</Location>, by which time recognition of his artistic accomplishment was both local and international. Corm had become an officer of the <Organization>Academy of France</Organization> in <Date>1936</Date> and was elected as an Honorary Member of the <Organization>Royal Society of Arts</Organization> in <Location>London</Location> in <Date>1955</Date>. He became an Officer of the <Organization><Origin>Lebanese</Origin> National</Organization> Order of the Cedar in <Date>1958</Date> and received numerous awards and honors throughout his lifetime.
Corm&apos;s paintings, predominantly oil on canvas and pastel on paper, document the importance of portraiture in <Location>Lebanon</Location> throughout the first half of the twentieth century, a market which his father painter Daoud Corm had worked to establish. The subjects of George Corm&apos;s portraits range from royalty and figures in high society, who commissioned his work, to everyday people, including several fellaheen, or peasants. He also completed a significant number of self-portraits, the most interesting of which capture Corm in his position as a painter and document an increasing awareness of the social status of the artist in twentieth century <Location>Lebanon</Location>.
In many ways, Corm&apos;s academic style recalls the work of his father, particularly in those pieces in which the artist sets the figure against a simple, darkly shaded background. However, Corm&apos;s formal language also moves away from the conventions of the previous generation as witnessed in his use of a lighter palette and looser brushwork. Such aesthetic shifts are most evident in Corm&apos;s still life and landscapes. Moreover, Corm&apos;s oeuvre includes a substantial number of nudes, a staple of European academic painting and a genre favored by this generation of <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> artists, including Corm&apos;s great contemporary, the painter César Gemayel (<Date>1898 - 1958</Date>). Corm&apos;s most distinctive work is in the genre of landscape. In addition to a series of more conventional landscapes of <Location>Lebanon</Location>&apos;s mountain ranges and coastline, Corm began during the early fifties to experiment with landscapes infused with spirituality, otherworldliness, and hidden symbolism.
Throughout his career as a painter, Corm continued to write and publish poetry, essays, and criticism. In 1966, he published his most well-known piece, Essai sur l&apos;art et la civilization de ce temps, in which Corm articulates an aesthetic position in the midst of a radically divided cold war culture. Critical of both <Origin>American</Origin> consumerism and Marxist Communism, Corm advocates a return to a classical European tradition of Humanism, rooted in Christian ethics. Corm&apos;s deep commitment to humanism and Christianity is evident in his paintings, which consistently feature the human figure as well as what critics have termed, &quot;paysages d&apos;âme,&quot; or spiritual landscapes.
Corm exhibited extensively in <Location>Beirut</Location> and <Location>Europe</Location>, and participated in in the 1966 Spring Salon in <Location>Paris</Location>. He died in <Location>Beirut</Location> on <Date>December 13, 1971</Date>. He was honored with a retrospective of his work in <Date>1981</Date> at the <Organization>Chamber of Commerce and Industry</Organization> in <Location>Beirut</Location> and in <Date>2013</Date> with the exhibition, &quot;<Origin>Lebanese</Origin> Painterly Humanism: Georges D. Corm,&quot; at the <Organization><Origin>American</Origin> University of Beirut Art Gallery</Organization>."

"Georges Sabbagh,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Georges-Sabbagh.aspx</Address>
Georges Hanna Sabbagh was born in <Date>1887</Date> into a wealthy <Organization>Catholic</Organization> family of Syro-<Origin>Lebanese</Origin> origin established in <Location>Alexandria</Location>. He was educated at the Collège des Pères Jésuites in <Location>Cairo</Location> before his father, Hanna Sabbagh Bey, one of the stakeholders of the Heliopolis urban development project, sent him to <Location>Paris</Location> in <Date>1906</Date> to study law. During that period, Georges Sabbagh showed little interest in his studies and instead started to take painting lessons at the Académie Ranson in <Date>1910</Date>. There he was trained by the painters Paul Sérusier (<Date>1864 - 1927</Date>), Félix Vallotton (<Date>1865 - 1925</Date>) and Maurice Denis (<Date>1870 - 1943</Date>). From that time on, he dedicated himself entirely to art.
During the First World War, <Date>between 1914 and 1915</Date>, Sabbagh enrolled in the <Origin>British</Origin> army. On his return to <Location>France</Location>, in <Date>1916</Date> he married the art historian and political activist Agnès Humbert (<Date>1894 -1</Date> 963), with whom he had two sons, Pierre and Jean. The same year, he spent several months in the Silencio villa of Maurice Denis located in the small village of <Location>Perros-</Location>Guirec in <Location>Brittany</Location>, the sole region of the Nabis and the painters of the École de Pont-Aven.  In 1917, Sabbagh held his first individual exhibition at the Galerie Chéron in <Location>Paris</Location>, which was a success. From then on, he became a renowned painter in <Location>Paris</Location> and was in touch with many of the artists working during the interwar period in the <Origin>French</Origin> capital, such as Modigliani, Jules-Emile Zingg, and Yves Alix and Henry de Waroquier.
In 1920, on the death of his mother, he returned to <Location>Egypt</Location> for the first time after more than ten years in <Location>Paris</Location>. While in <Location>Egypt</Location>, he produced several paintings addressing the themes of motherhood and family. He returned to <Location>France</Location> in <Date>1922</Date> and traveled regularly to Crozant, to visit his friend, the painter Armand Guillaumin (<Date>1841 - 1927</Date>). In 1928, he built a house in Ploumanac&apos;h in <Location>Brittany</Location> close to the villa of Maurice Denis that inspired several of his paintings. Sabbagh became a <Origin>French</Origin> citizen in <Date>1930</Date>. He left <Location>France</Location> to return to <Location>Egypt</Location> in <Date>1936</Date> and lived there until 1945. During that period, he produced many landscapes, townscapes as well as still lifes. In 1951, he traveled to <Location>Switzerland</Location> where he held exhibitions in <Location>Geneva</Location> and Lausanne and died in <Location>Paris</Location> the same year, on the <Date>9th of December</Date>.
Georges Sabbagh spent most of his life in <Location>Paris</Location>, where he built his career. Although he was very attached to his <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> origins, he considered himself a painter of the École de <Location>Paris</Location>. He was a prolific artist, who produced over a thousand oil paintings as wel​l as many engravings. His early paintings are marked by the lessons of the Nabis, particularly by his teacher and friend, Maurice Denis, who initiated him into the emotional power of color and symbolism. Sabbagh, along with some of his contemporaries working in <Location>Paris</Location>, such as his friends Yves Alix and Jules-Emile Zingg, belonged to what the critic Jean Cassou called &quot;the sacrificed generation.&quot; These artists assimilated the experiences of the Nabis, the Cubists and the Fauves, while searching for a new form of Realism. In 1918, he paid tribute to his forefathers, by representing Cézanne and Van Gogh in his painting entitled Les joueurs de cartes.
Overall, Sabbagh remained independent and original in his pictorial style, by continuously following modern trends while expressing the powerful light and colors of his country of origin. He painted many portraits of his contemporaries, friends, and family, as well as marines of <Location>Brittany</Location> and landscapes of the <Origin>Egyptian</Origin>, <Origin>French</Origin> and <Origin>Swiss</Origin> countryside. During his lifetime, Sabbagh held twenty-eight individual exhibitions and participated in more than 130 collective exhibits. He held one of his last exhibitions at the Galerie Motte in <Location>Geneva</Location> in <Date>1951</Date>. After his death, many retrospective exhibitions where organized in his honor and in <Date>1981</Date>, Pierre and Jean Sabbagh dedicated a monograph to their father that shed light on his life, work and career. His works can be seen in many collections around the world, including the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> <Organization>Art</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the <Organization>Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> and the Mathaf <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>. In <Date>2013</Date>, several works of Georges Sabbagh were presented in the exhibition &quot;Tea with Nefertiti&quot; held at Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location> and at the <Organization>Institut du Monde Arabe</Organization> in <Location>Paris</Location> under the title &quot;Le Théorème de Nefertiti.&quot;"

"Gita Meh,http://www.sharjahart.org/people/people-by-alphabet/m/meh-gita</Address>
<Origin>Iranian</Origin> artist Gita Meh uses visual and written language as tools to form a space for human interaction and cultural integration, goals that originate from her own personal history and experience of migration and intercultural negotiation.
While working with a range of media including painting, sculpture and installation, she is perhaps best known for her performance work. For the <Date>2009</Date> <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization>, Meh recreated Soffreh, an installation and performance piece where a table is covered with a &apos;cloth&apos; made of sugar and a meal prepared. The audience are invited to join in the feast and to draw in the sugar while sharing their experiences, conversation and ultimately friendship. In Farsi, soffreh means tablecloth, and for Meh, this work &apos;becomes a prayer place, a dance place, a home place, it becomes belonging. It reflects the architecture of my past in a personal context.&apos;
Meh investigates issues of place, space, pleasure and identity in work that draws on her own experience of the duality of Middle Eastern and Western cultures, then reconstructs and reinforces the best of both traditions.
Soffreh has been recreated in locations around the world including <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization> (<Date>2009</Date>), Jam Jar, <Location>Dubai</Location> (<Date>2008</Date>), <Location>Los Angeles</Location> (<Date>2003</Date>) and <Location>Valencia</Location>, <Location>Spain</Location> (<Date>1996</Date>).

Her work has been included in group exhibitions, notably at the <Organization>Museum of Contemporary Art</Organization>, <Location>Tehran</Location> (<Date>2008</Date>).

"Golnaz Fathi,http://www.thethirdline.com/artists/golnaz-fathi/biography/</Address>
A trained calligrapher, Golnaz Fathi has turned the literary art-form on its head by skillfully transforming known language into form and composition. She first discovered calligraphy while studying graphic design at <Location>Tehran</Location>’s <Organization>Azad University</Organization>, which she later left to train for six years at the <Organization>Calligraphy Association of Iran</Organization>. Practicing the script for over seven hours a day eventually paid off – she was the first woman to win an award for Ketabat (a genre of calligraphy) – but she soon tired of the discipline’s rules and regulations. Hence, she created a new form of expression in her paintings; an imaginary language deeply rooted in Persian tradition while simultaneously hinting at a social renaissance.
Her paintings carry traces of meaning that have no known coded alphabet. The strength of her work stems from the drive to express emotions that cannot be pinned down into words. Golnaz&apos;s works succeeds where language fails. 
Golnaz has exhibited in a number of international shows, including at The <Organization>Art</Organization> of Writing, <Organization>Art</Organization> Forum of <Location>Wiesbaden</Location>, <Location>Germany</Location> (<Date>2011</Date>); Transvangarde, Contemporary <Organization>Art</Organization> from Around the World, <Date>October</Date> <Organization>Gallery</Organization>, <Location>London</Location>, <Location>UK</Location> (<Date>2011</Date>); Ride Like the Wind, <Organization>Sultan Gallery</Organization>, <Location>Kuwait</Location> (<Date>2010</Date>) and participated in the International Woman Artists’ Biennial, <Location>South Korea</Location> (<Date>2009</Date>).

"Hafidh al-Droubi,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Hafidh-al-Droubi.aspx</Address>
Hafidh al-Droubi (<Date>1914 - 1991</Date>) is primarily remembered for his work as an educator and developer of art pedagogy in <Location>Iraq</Location> during the mid-twentieth century. Yet he was also an active painter who possessed a talent for capturing the beauty of everyday life through a sophisticated manipulation of form and color. Al-Droubi is considered one of the pioneers of <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> modern art as he made several early contributions to its development. 
Al-Droubi began his formal education in the arts at the Accademia Reale in <Location>Rome</Location>, becoming one of the first <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> artists to study abroad. He would later earn a degree from <Organization>Goldsmiths College</Organization> in <Location>London</Location> in <Date>1950</Date>. After his studies in <Location>Rome</Location>, he returned to <Location>Iraq</Location> and became an active participant in the burgeoning art scene. During the formative years between studying in <Location>Rome</Location> and <Location>London</Location>, Al-Droubi took several steps to professionalize art practice in <Location>Iraq</Location>. In 1941, he established <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s first free artist studio, which gave aspiring artists a space to learn and practice art-making. In the subsequent decade, Al-Droubi opened similar artist studios at the Faculty of <Organization>Arts</Organization> and Sciences at <Organization>Baghdad University</Organization>, where he could supervise and encourage emerging talent. Many other studios like these opened around <Location>Baghdad</Location>, each headed by established artist. This system proved highly effective as many notable <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> artists received their early training from these ateliers.
Hafidh al-Droubi was a crucial figures in the development of modernism in <Location>Iraq</Location>, especially in the realm of art education. In the course of a career that included service in important positions like the Deanship of the <Organization>Academy of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location> and the Chair of the <Organization>Society of <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> Plastic</Organization> <Organization>Arts</Organization>, he demonstrated a deep commitment to providing knowledge and resources for succeeding generations. Indeed, he was instrumental in instilling the value of art education among his student and colleagues. 
Al-Droubi&apos;s work can be appreciated <Date>today</Date> in many settings around the world, including museums, government buildings, and universities; foremost among these sites is Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>, <Location>Qatar</Location> and the <Organization>Jordan National</Organization> Gallery of Fine <Organization>Art</Organization> in <Location>Amman</Location>, <Location>Jordan</Location>.

"Haleh Redjaian,http://ivde.net/artists/haleh_redjaian/biography</Address>
Haleh Redjaian (b. <Date>1971</Date>, <Location>Frankfurt</Location>) lives and works in <Location>Berlin</Location>.
Redjaian’s works on paper, textiles and site-specific wall installations are grounded in geometry, but she uses its rules to reshape and retrace the apparent order of angles and lines. Her compositions subtly belie their own errors and form what she calls a ‘natural abstract language’.
Redjaian believes that these works, nimble yet systematic, refer in part to the manner in which people create, adapt to and deviate from order in their lives. She will often base her drawings on a precise background, such as grid paper, and weave graphite into its rigid structures with rough shadings and free-radical lines. Conversely, Redjaian may overlay two pieces of grid paper, drawing directly onto their discordant lines, creating a paradoxical order in the result.
A similar approach can be seen in the artist’s textiles, for which she appropriates carpets made in <Location>Kerman</Location>, <Location>Iran</Location>, and lightly stitches patterns onto them. The irregularities in these hand-knotted carpets contrast with the long, smooth lines of thread she stitches over the top. A conversation of abstraction takes place within the threads of the fabric, between these two hand-made yet very different systems.
Redjaian’s recent solo exhibitions include; Same Same but different, (<Date>2013</Date>) at Vincenz Sala, <Location>Berlin</Location>, and <Date>Friday</Date> Night Lights, Sox, <Location>Berlin</Location>. She also participated in Blossom on the tree you know how I feel (<Date>2013</Date>), a dual exhibition with Henry Kleine at <Date>September</Date>, <Location>Berlin</Location>. Her first exhibition at <Organization>Gallery Isabelle van den Eynde</Organization> is as part of <Location>Nice</Location> Drawings (<Date>2015</Date>)."

Halla Bint Khalid is an author and illustrator of children&apos;s books in both Arabic and <Origin>English</Origin>, with her own publishing house: DarJerboa Children&apos;s Books in <Location>Riyadh</Location>. She is also an established painter and has since <Date>1988</Date> become experienced in many techniques, using oilpaint, watercolour, both dry and oil pastel, gouache and acrylic. Her paintings, of which we found images online, show her working in the realistic manner of a storyteller of the past and memory. We were charmed by a passing guard in front of the windows of a nineteen fifties automobile, with only partly visible on the back seat an image of former king AbdulAziz, who was given the nick name &apos;Al Shuyook,&apos; because he was not only sheikh of his tribe, but as king also head of all tribes. On her facebook page the artist made it known that she made the painting using a model for the guard and that moving outside with the model, having him stand in the sun, added to her grasp of reality, when his eyes and face reacted to the sun. Another realistic image made by the artist, which could be seen on her facebook page, is of a portrait of a man whom she describes as the &apos;milk brother and chaperone&apos; of her mother.

"Hamed Nada,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Hamed-Nada.aspx</Address>
Hamed Nada was born in the neighborhood of al-Khalifa near the Citadel in <Location>Cairo</Location>. As the son of a sheikh, he was raised in a religious environment and was profoundly influenced in his childhood by the everyday life of the areas of al-Khalifa and Sayyida Zeinab. In the beginning of the 1940&apos;s, he was a student at the <Organization>Secondary School of Hilmiyya</Organization> (then Faruk <Organization>Ist School</Organization>) where he developed an interest in art, psychology and philosophy. During that time, he met the painter and pedagogue Hussein Youssef Amin (<Date>1904 - 1984</Date>) who was teaching drawing in secondary schools. Amin had rejected the academic system of the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> and adopted a new method of art education, based on the individual development and freedom of expression of his students. This experience gave birth to the <Organization>Group of Contemporary Art</Organization> in which many of Amin&apos;s pupils such as Hamed Nada, Abdel Hadi el-Gazzar, Ibrahim Massouda, Maher Raif, Kamal Youssef, Salim el-Habashi, Samir Rafi and Mahmoud Khalil were included. The group held its first exhibition in <Date>May 1946</Date> at the Lycée <Origin>Français</Origin> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, presenting around 200 works mostly portraying popular life in <Location>Egypt</Location> and touching on social concerns.
In 1948, Nada joined the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, where he studied under the painters Ahmed Sabry (<Date>1889 - 1955</Date>) and Youssef Kamel (<Date>1891 - 1971</Date>) and graduated in <Date>1951</Date>. During his studies, he contributed as an illustrator and critic to the literary review, Al-Thaqafa, together with prominent writers and poets such as Taha Hussein and Louis Awad. In 1956, he was a member of the <Location>Luxor</Location> Atelier, which was created in <Date>1941</Date> by <Organization>Alexandrian</Organization> painter Mohammed Naghi (<Date>1888 - 1956</Date>) to promote the study of ancient <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> art by art students. Nada stayed in <Location>Luxor</Location> for one year, observing and studying the frescoes and reliefs of the temples in the <Location>Valley</Location> of Thebes. When he returned to <Location>Cairo</Location> in <Date>1957</Date>, he was appointed professor of painting at the <Organization>Faculty of Fine Arts</Organization> in Alexandria the year it was founded by the sculptor Ahmad Osman (<Date>1907 - 1970</Date>). In 1960, Nada received a scholarship to study mural painting at the <Organization>Royal Academy</Organization> of Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> of <Location>San Fernando</Location> in <Location>Madrid</Location>. After obtaining his diploma in <Date>1961</Date>, he was appointed as a professor at the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> and became the head of the painting department in <Date>1977</Date>. He continued to work part-time as a teacher after his retirement in <Date>1984</Date> and died on the <Date>27th of May 1990</Date> after a fall in his studio in al-Ghuriyya during a power shortage.
Hamed Nada is one of the most prominent painters of the <Organization>Group of Contemporary Art</Organization>. He was one of the first modern <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> artists, along with his colleague and friend, the painter Abdel Hadi al-Gazzar, to introduce superstitious symbols and to express human psychology and unconscious fear in his paintings. His early works are strongly influenced by the social environment of the popular areas of <Location>Cairo</Location>, from which his teacher, Hussein Youssef Amin, encouraged him to draw his inspiration. Nada developed a symbolist pictorial universe nourished by legends of storytellers, popular beliefs and superstitions, as well as the magical and mysterious world of djins. His works from the 1950&apos;s depict interior scenes of poor communal households, expressing the intimacy of human resignation and fatalism. As a metaphor of the human soul, the cat, the lamp and the chair are recurrent symbols in his paintings. During the 1960&apos;s, after closely studying the arts of Ancient <Location>Egypt</Location> while a resident at the <Location>Luxor</Location> Atelier, Nada&apos;s work started to unfold into two -dimensional spaces animated by stylized and distorted human figures. He also used brighter colors to represent scenes of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> daily life and political subjects. In these works, one can sometimes discern the influence of Ragheb Ayad (<Date>1892 - 1982</Date>), though Nada brought the representation of popular culture to a symbolist and universal level by painting poetic tales of the intimate lives of working-class Egyptians. His works can be seen at the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> <Organization>Art</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the <Organization>Museum of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location>, Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>, as well as in numerous private collections all around the world."

"Hamed Owais,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Hamed-Owais.aspx</Address>
Mohammed Hamed Owais was born in <Date>1919</Date> into a peasant family in the small village of <Location>Kafr</Location> Mansour in the governorate of Beni Soueif. There, he received his primary and secondary education before working as a metalworker. He soon realized he was not fit for this profession and moved to <Location>Cairo</Location>, where he joined the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization>. After he graduated in <Date>1944</Date>, he pursued his studies at the <Organization>Institute of Art Education</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, where he was trained by the pedagogue and critic Youssef el-Afifi. He received his diploma in <Date>1946</Date> and in the following year, he founded the <Organization>Group of Modern Art</Organization>, together with other artists of his generation, such as Gamal el-Sigini, Gazbia Sirry, Zeinab Abdel Hamid, Salah Yousri and Youssef Sida.
<Date>From 1948 to 1955</Date>, Owais worked as a drawing teacher in the <Organization>Farouk Ist Secondary School</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location>. He traveled to <Location>Italy</Location> in <Date>1952</Date> and visited the <Organization>Venice Biennale</Organization> where the works of <Origin>Italian</Origin> Social Realist artists were being exhibited. In 1958, he was appointed a professor at the <Organization>Faculty of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location> just after it was founded by the sculptor Ahmad Osman (<Date>1907 - 1970</Date>). In 1967, Owais received a scholarship to continue his studies at the <Organization>Royal Academy</Organization> of Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> of <Location>San Fernando</Location> in <Location>Madrid</Location> where he received his diploma in <Date>1969</Date>. <Date>From 1977 to 1979</Date>, he served as the head of the <Organization>Faculty of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location>. He died in <Location>Cairo</Location> in <Date>2011</Date>, at the age of ninety-two.
Hamed Owais is one of the leading Social Realist painters in <Location>Egypt</Location>. His work embodies the struggle of the people of the <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> working class: peasants, fishermen, laborers, factory workers, craftsmen, barbers, builders and market sellers. He was one of the first <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> artists to address the question of unemployment and the everyday life of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> laborers in the 1940&apos;s and 1950&apos;s. His work was strongly influenced by the ideas of the <Organization>Group of Modern Art</Organization>, whose members rejected Surrealism, as they believed that art should touch the masses and clearly reflect social ideologies. Owais, like other artists of his generation, such as Gamal el-Sigini, was a partisan of the ideals of the 1952 revolution, which he expressed in his works. He admired the European modernists such as Picasso and Matisse and found affinity with <Origin>Mexican</Origin> Social Realists, such as the muralists Diego Rivera (<Date>1886 - 1957</Date>) and David Alfaro Siqueiros (<Date>1896 - 1974</Date>).
Owais developed a clear and direct style portraying the life of the average <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> worker. His peasants or fishermen are massive and muscular, which reflects the strength of his social convictions. Their large bodies often seem to be enclosed in the reduced space of the canvas that appears as a metaphor of the social boundaries of the <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> society. When he moved to Alexandria, Owais was influenced by the abundance of light and vibrant colors of the <Location>Mediterranean</Location> port, as well as by the work of Alexandrian painter Mahmoud Saïd (<Date>1897 - 1964</Date>). Although Hamed Owais is commonly associated with the socialist ideology of the Gamal Abdel Nasser era, his original style and work overall reflect his humanist character.

Hayv Kahraman uses the visual languages of the <Origin>Italian</Origin> Renaissance, and the figurative style of traditional <Origin>Japanese</Origin> and Islamic art in intricately detailed paintings of women as they carry out the rituals of daily or celebratory life.
Intrinsic to Kahraman&apos;s work is the aesthetic and conceptual fusion of cultures that is characteristic of the increasingly global and multicultural experience of life <Date>today</Date>. Exploring issues of both gender and the empowerment of women, Kahraman&apos;s subversive figurative narratives reflect societal concerns and defy doctrinal behavioural patterns. The figures are semi-realistically rendered symbolic representations of the modern platonic form of the feminine, an ambiguous existence on the cusp of dejection and defiance.
Included in the 9th <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization> was Domesticated Marionettes, a series of paintings created between <Date>2008-09</Date>.

She has a master of fine arts from <Organization>Minneapolis College of Art and Design</Organization> (<Date>2002</Date>) and lives in <Location>St. Paul</Location>, <Location>Minnesota</Location>.
She writes that she uses art to achieve social change, exploring belief systems, especially those dealing with women, while cultivating the independence of Arab art from Western art and its distinction from other Middle Eastern and Islamic identities.
&apos;My work is often a portrait of a woman,&apos; Al-Mansour writes on her website. &apos;I make drawings of stylized figures and faces representing those women and integrate them with Islamic ornamentation. I then silk screen them onto fabrics, often using henna and dye and often repetitively. I use large sheets of silk, wool, canvas, or other cottons. Then I build shrines and tents with these fabrics, creating spaces in which the viewer walks barefoot.&apos;
In a similar way Al-Mansour has also produced two large books, one of which was the 5 by 4 foot Autobiography of a Human Body (<Date>2000</Date>).
Some of her installations were commissioned for theater and dance productions such as the Arab and Jewish houses which were part of the set of a musical show. (<Date>2009</Date>).

Hesam Rahmanian (b. <Location>Knoxville</Location>, <Date>1980</Date>) lives and works in <Location>Dubai</Location>.
His works begin from found fragments – a discarded household object, for example, an innocuous shape in a polaroid or a smear of hardened, leftover paint – that have some glancing resemblance to a body, a face or an animal. From this simple bricolage, Rahmanian searches for ways that he can develop his impressions, either on canvas or as assemblage, with a playfulness and spontaneity that is faithful to his initial glimpse. This first-thought-best-thought way of working has emerged steadily from the artist’s early painting series’, which were underpinned by metaphor and social commentary.
Rahmanian has had solo exhibitions at <Organization>Gallery Isabelle van den Eynde</Organization> (<Date>2013</Date>), <Organization>Paradise Row</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>2011</Date>) and Traffic, <Location>Dubai</Location> (<Date>2010</Date>).

"Huda Lutfi,http://www.thethirdline.com/artists/huda-lutfi/biography/</Address>
Huda Lutfi is a cultural, feminist historian by professional training whose work in the field of the visual arts translates these affiliations in multiple complex ways. In her artwork, Huda excavates and makes vocal the silenced voices and marginalized spaces that cross various historical and cultural contexts mapping, as it does the politics of her engagement both as a historian and as an artist. Cultural hybridity is Huda&apos;s genealogy; it lies at the heart of her work enabling her to travel among and dialogue with many artistic traditions with which she shares the desire to liberate the human spirit and imaginary while tracing an inner meditative state of being.
<Location>Cairo</Location> is one of the main sources that inspire Huda&apos;s work living and working as she does within the ancient metropolis. In her art work she reinvents <Location>Cairo</Location> through its found objects collected over the years from some of the city’s main “repositories” from Suq al-Imam in <Location>Cairo</Location>’s <Location>City</Location> of the Dead to the downtown Azbakiyya bookstalls, that represent <Location>Cairo</Location>’s cosmopolitan and global culture all the way to Tahrir itself during <Location>Egypt</Location>’s ongoing revolution. Huda&apos;s more recent work in photo montage bears testimony to the extent to which Cairenes’ lives, in the everyday and in revolt have impacted her artistic vision and further sharpened her politics of visual engagement."

"Huda Totonji,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-hudatotonja.html</Address>
Huda Totonji might exist in an imagined space somewhere in between <Location>Washington</Location> and <Location>Jeddah</Location>. This is a space where masculine poetry is mastered by learning and examination and from where travel is possible in both directions. In <Location>Jeddah</Location> the artist may land herself as a philosophical doctor of visual technology and in <Location>Washington</Location> she may arrive as a true master of calligraphy. She has earned both these qualifications. The artist-researcher and teacher will not have herself pinned down in a single category. She &apos;chooses to bounce between image and text,&apos; is what she writes on her website, and to this should be added that she believes good restaurants should manage to serve a large menu. Her art ranges from painting in several genres, such as portrait, landscape, still life and calligraphy, to mixed media installations and performances. In none of it however she will represent women &apos;physically&apos; as was often done in the history of western figurative art. <Organization>Her George Mason University</Organization> master thesis installation Birdwatcher (<Date>2004</Date>) seemed to mock such orientalist paintings as Ingres&apos;s Grande Odalisque or anything of the like by Matisse and other artists who are central to the western canon of art. In fact Orientalism itself might qualify as &apos;birdwatching&apos; if you come to think of it. Huda Totonja would have disappointed the oriental minded gentlemen in their <Location>London</Location> and Parisian chambers and clubs. Her giant birdcage was empty and only feathers and hairpins were left for such eager-to-collect and very civilised men. So was it about <Location>Iraq</Location> and <Location>Afghanistan</Location>? The artist probably never intended it to be like that. But, whoever thought that there would be a giant bird of wings, bones and flesh to be caught in that war, might have better reviewed Totonja&apos;s empty cage first. This is what she says: that the female vision is central to what she makes.

Hussein Al-Mohasen&apos;s (<Date>1971</Date>) expressionist paintings are extraordinary colourful and where with Pollock you may end up with a vision of a late universe by night, with Mohasen you arrive closer to the big bang and on one of the very first days. Nevertheless, the artist realizes with full modesty the limits of his ability, when it is said that he paints to music, sometimes jazz, and that his real wish is to tell stories. Blue Stories, such was the name of an exhibition of his work in Al-Khobar in <Date>2007</Date>. So he is a dancer of the ballet in which, as in the <Origin>French</Origin> cuisine and medieval warfare, one knows: the men jump higher than the women. 
Al-Mohasen is from Qatif where he is a member of the arts society. He has had group and solo exhibitions around KSA since <Date>the late 1990s</Date> and has met with increasing popularity. His work may be found around the country in a number of galleries and the work looks consistent and growing. As is unusual in <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>, he is said to be able to generate enough income from his art to be a fulltime artist breaking through old conventions of perception about the value of art. 
The artist has a sound opinion on art history which is quoted by Arab News: &quot;Its good to study art history but I dont believe that its right to let the past work of others hold me back from creating what is in my imagination.&quot; It is essential though to study life and a little art history.

Idris Khan, after completing his studies in Fine <Organization>Art</Organization> at the <Organization>Royal College of Art</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>2004</Date>), has gone on to transform texts, musical scores, dances and artworks into melancholic investigations of appropriation, time, and memory. Digitally layering photographs or film clips of the appropriated material, he creates dense accumulations that empathise with the past while engaging with contemporary discourses. Individual notes, words and images become translucent marks and traces. Although these traces signify a fading of the past, they reveal Khan’s painterly approach by forming new patterns and rhythms that fight against reality and present a meditative space for contemplation. Idris Khan, born in <Location>Birmingham</Location> in <Date>1978</Date>, lives and works in <Location>London</Location>. He has had numerous solo exhibitions internationally, including at Elementa, <Location>Dubai</Location>, and K20, <Location>Dusseldorf</Location>.

"Iman Raad,http://ivde.net/artists/iman_raad/biography</Address>
<Origin>Iranian</Origin> artist Iman Raad (born <Location>Mashad</Location>, <Location>Iran</Location>, <Date>1979</Date>) draws on ancient visual heritages from <Location>North Africa</Location>, the <Location>Middle East</Location> and <Location>central Asia</Location> to weave vivid embroideries, drawings and designs that reconcile traditional mystical and imagined talismans and folkloric tales with contemporary existence. His most recent works, embroideries that markedly extend from those exhibited by Raad at What Lies Beneath in <Date>2011</Date>, are intriguing fusions of the fantastical, the historical and the present, and reveal an intricacy inspired by a vast array of aesthetics, from architecture, calligraphy, pottery and religious flags while blaring a naivety observed in folk culture, everyday script writing and public banners. The embroideries in Raad’s most recent series contain extracts from the poem Shah-nameh by Persian poet Ferdowsi (940-1020 CE). The poem describes existence shadowed by the horrors of demons, as well as life free of them. Raad transforms the meaning of the demon texts, transforming the setting of the words to his colourful and richly sources visual language. He mocks, taunts, and challenges, presenting playful offerings of hope as well as despair and criticism.
Raad lives and works in <Location>Tehran</Location>, where he has worked in the field of <Organization>Graphic Design</Organization> for many years. His refined, hand-draughted typography and designs reveal works that walk the line between graphic design and art. He has been invited to participate in What Lies Beneath at <Organization>Gallery IVDE</Organization>, <Location>Dubai</Location> (<Date>2011</Date> and <Date>2012</Date>), the inaugural show of JAMM in <Location>Kuwait</Location> (<Date>2011</Date>), and Right-to-Left at Studio 1 Kunstquartier (<Date>2012</Date>), and additionally has been published in numerous design books including ‘Area 2’ (Phaidon) and a global compilation of designers entitled ‘One by One’ (<Organization>Hesign Publishing &amp; Design</Organization>). Raad has been awarded a number of prizes at national and international poster contests, including First Prize at the Trnava Poster Triennial in <Date>2009</Date>."

"Janet Hagopian,http://www.artclvb.com/artist/janet-hagobian</Address>
The experience of being caught in three cultures not wholly different, and yet not the same, dominates my creative work. Each of my pieces offers a glimpse into the social and religious realities that shape my identity, and those of the Armenian women living in the <Location>Middle East</Location>. In my work, I pay a great deal of attention to the structures of forms, shapes, and colours, which create the inhabitable space that begins to resemble stories and life experiences behind the composition. The idea is to allow viewers to detach themselves from notions of normality, and question their reason for existence. These shapes symbolise the idea of isolation conferred by this perspective.My pieces are composed of various layers that convey the concept of the painting. My imagination explores and displays shape variations in order to communicate strong compositions. Painting such shapes are challenging, but viewing them allows audiences to observe without feeling any restrictions or constraints."

Javad Azimi (b. <Date>1977</Date>, Gorgan, <Location>Iran</Location>) studied at the <Organization>Art University of Tehran</Organization> and subsequently returned to his hometown in <Location>Northern Iran</Location> to live and work. Azimi grew up surrounded by nature, and the landscapes of his region, colourful and ever-changing, are a vital source of inspiration in his painting.
Besides the influence of natural environments, Azimi’s work reveals his profound absorption with his cultural heritage, from the crafts of Gorgan and Qajari painting to Seljuki art and architecture.
Azimi presents two bodies of work in this exhibition. The first group, a series of still lifes, are celebratory banquets of elaborate decoration, bejeweled with hints of the artist’s inspirations, yet primitive and instinctic in their hand-painted appearance. The second body is a collection of paintings of fragile sleeping women who lie stranded, in a state of abandon. They, as with the still lifes, hover isolated in spaces that suggest emptiness and tranquility simultaneously."

Jessica Mein (b. <Date>1975</Date> <Location>São Paulo</Location>, <Location>Brazil</Location>) lives and works in <Location>Dubai</Location>, <Location>UAE</Location>, <Location>Sao</Location> Paolo, <Location>Brazil</Location> and <Location>New York</Location>, <Location>U.S.A.</Location> Mein’s works range in media and include works on paper, canvas and textile, and stop motion animation to reveal the ruptures between source material and the images they produce. Her broader body of work contends with the surface, structure and materiality of image and resists actual narratives that frame her subject matter. As such, the medium becomes deeply implicated in the depicted subject, whether it be obsolete paper billboards from her hometown <Location>São Paulo</Location> or the movement and labor of bodies within social and physical spaces. In each of these instances error, accident and imperfection are foregrounded even as Mein challenges the speed that drives contemporary visual culture by utilizing meticulous drawing and cutting techniques to construct her work.
Mein exhibits internationally, including solo shows at Simon Preston Gallery (<Location>New York</Location>) <Date>November 2013</Date>; Galeria Leme (<Location>São Paulo</Location>, <Location>Brazil</Location>); <Organization>The Pavilion Downtown (Dubai)</Organization>; and major group exhibitions at <Organization>Julia Stoschek Foundation (Germany)</Organization>; <Organization>Museo Tamayo</Organization> de Arte Contemporáneo (<Location>Mexico</Location>); and The Street Files Biennial El <Organization>Museo</Organization> del Barrio (<Location>New York</Location>) among others.

"Jilali Gharbaoui,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Jilali-Gharbaoui.aspx</Address>
Jilali Gharbaoui began taking painting classes while in secondary school in <Location>Fes</Location>, at the Académie des Arts. With the support of the novelist Ahmed Sefrioui, director of fine arts in <Location>Rabat</Location>, Gharbaoui was able to receive a scholarship to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of <Location>Paris</Location>, where he took classes with Jean Souverbie and often visited the atelier <Location>La Grande</Location> Chaumière. He studied an additional year in <Location>Rome</Location>, and often returned to <Location>Paris</Location>, where he was introduced as part of the &quot;groupe des informels&quot; at the Salon Comparaison in <Date>1959</Date> by art critic Pierre Restany. He was particularly influenced by classical Flemish painting after a trip to <Location>Amsterdam</Location> in <Date>1962</Date>. Gharbaoui suffered from severe mental illness, and was hosted on multiple occasions by Father Denis Martin at the monastery of Toumliline in the Middle <Location>Atlas Mountains</Location>. In <Date>the late 1960s</Date>, major <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> art collector Abderrahman Serghini bought a large part of his works and studio. Like other <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> artists at the time, Gharbaoui&apos;s extensive travels were motivated by the lack of infrastructure and support for the arts in <Location>Morocco</Location>, and he was outspoken about these issues in print, as in the 1967 &quot;fiches et questionnaires&quot; in the leftist cultural journal Souffles. In <Date>1971</Date>, Gharbaoui&apos;s body was found on a public bench in the Champ de Mars. His body was repatriated to <Location>Morocco</Location> by André Malraux, and he is buried in <Location>Fes</Location>.
In Gharbaoui&apos;s short lifetime, he played a major role in furthering the debates around <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> modernism. Along with Ahmed Cherkaoui, Jilali Gharbaoui is considered one of the founders of modernism in <Location>Morocco</Location>. While Gharbaoui felt himself and his art to be deeply influenced by <Location>Morocco</Location>, particularly by the colors of <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> earth, it was not in the direct and traceable way of Cherkaoui&apos;s work. Many contemporaneous <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> artists, such as Farid Belkahia and Mohammed Melehi, worked to root their modernist abstractions in the signs and symbols of <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> visual culture. Unlike his contemporaries, however, Gharbaoui distanced himself from these debates, centering his work on the gesture of painting itself. Although Gharbaoui worked with both sculpture and painting, he is best known for the striking colors and violent brush-strokes of his gestural abstractions on canvas, paper, and wood. Very early works by Gharbaoui are relatively representational or focus on geometric abstraction, but later works are easily identified by a consistent style of loose abstract work that focuses on the movement of the brush itself. The paintings deliberately highlight the hand of the artist and often build up texture through thick layers of paint, showcasing both the interplay of colors and lines as well as the materiality of the paint itself.
During his lifetime, Gharbaoui exhibited widely in <Location>Morocco</Location> and internationally, in <Location>Egypt</Location>, <Location>France</Location>, <Location>the Netherlands</Location>, the <Location>United States</Location>, and <Location>Brazil</Location>. As part of the &quot;groupe des informels,&quot; Gharbaoui participated in an exhibition that moved to <Location>Japan</Location>, <Location>Mexico</Location>, and <Location>Germany</Location>.  Particularly since <Date>the 1990s</Date>, Gharbaoui&apos;s importance has been celebrated through a number of exhibitions and books. Gharbaoui was the focus of a <Date>1993</Date> retrospective at the <Organization>Institut du Monde Arabe</Organization>, as well as the monograph Fulgurances Gharbaoui by Yasmina Filali, published the same year in <Location>Casablanca</Location>. A film on Gharbaoui was additionally commissioned by Filali and the <Organization>IMA</Organization> by Faten Safieddine. Within <Location>Morocco</Location>, the <Organization>Museum Bank</Organization> Al-Maghrib (<Date>2011</Date>) and the Villa des Arts/Fondation ONA of <Location>Rabat</Location> and <Location>Casablanca</Location> (<Date>2010</Date>) have also hosted large retrospectives of Gharbaoui&apos;s work.

"Jowhara Al-Saud ,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-jowharaalsaud.html</Address>
Jowhara Al-Saud (<Date>1978</Date>) is one of those people who have lived &apos;out of <Location>Jeddah</Location>&apos; in <Location>America</Location>. In <Location>Massachusetts</Location> she was thoroughly educated in the arts and most interestingly started with film theory to end with mixed media at the school of The <Organization>Museum of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Boston</Location>. Presently her <Origin>American</Origin> home appears to be <Location>New York</Location>.Al-Saud&apos;s work can be seen on her own website and on sites of several galleries in <Location>London</Location>, <Location>New York</Location> and soon in <Location>Berlin</Location> and even Amsterdam. Of these websites only the artist&apos;s own site allows us to have a look at older work like White Trash Barbie and a harrowing fantasy of <Location>Orlando</Location> Barbie murders in what looks like a set designed for the Thunderbirds starring in a Hitchcock movie.
On her website Al-Saud allows us not only older work, but also more words than galleries usually find necessary. They are about her current project, which is a series by the name of &apos;Out of line.&apos; Again, it looks like a storyboard, but this time the movie is not about reality dolls but about the real lives of <Origin>Saudi</Origin>&apos;s whose pictures have been brought in line with demands of censorship on showing personal imagery. For this the artist has removed their skin and faces. The people in the images may however not really be bothered by any official censorship. Foreign stamps and airmail letters imply they are mostly &apos;out of border&apos; living <Origin>Saudi</Origin>&apos;s, which raises a question. Is it the official, sometimes silly, censorship in KSA that Al-Saud was dealing with or is it perhaps the universal struggle every artist has with telling all without implicating family and friends, who prefer privacy over the stage? It seems that where the official censor stays within the borders of KSA this unofficial one reaches far beyond such lines.About the adapted work the artist writes: &apos;when reduced to sketches, the images achieved enough distance from the original photographs that neither subjects nor censors could find them objectionable. For me, they became autonomous, relatable, pared down narratives.&apos; And she adds a note on photography in general: &apos;I try to undermine any documentary authority it may possess as a medium.&apos; 
It does confuse: narratives without authority. We may get lost or put our trust in the titles the artist has given her images. Some of them like <Organization>Clowns &amp; Jokers</Organization> and The Harrowing Adventures of.. appear rooted in the exercise of bringing Barbie dolls to reality, but now reflect behaviour of perfectly normal people, who may prefer to live within their borders.

"Khalid al-Jader,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Khalid-al-Jader.aspx</Address>
Dr. Khalid al-Jader (<Date>1922 - 1988</Date>) was a highly active participant in the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> modern art movement. He held several prominent positions and memberships in art institutions and organizations throughout his distinguished career. Al-Jader&apos;s work is known for its rural landscapes and village vistas rendered in sweeping brushstrokes. He was attracted to Impressionism and his pieces exhibit many of its aesthetic devices. However, his exploration of style and subject matter transcended these aesthetic similarities to produce what the Palestinian writer, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, calls a distinct <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> nature.
A gifted student, Al-Jader studied at the <Organization>College of Law</Organization> and the <Organization>Institute of Fine Art</Organization> concurrently, graduating in <Date>1946</Date> with degrees in art and law. He then travelled to <Location>Paris</Location> on scholarship to study at the Ècole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-<Organization>Arts</Organization> in <Date>1954</Date> and earned a Ph.D. in the History of Islamic <Organization>Art</Organization> from the Sorbonne. While in <Location>Paris</Location>, Al-Jader joined the Salon de <Location>Paris</Location>.  
Upon returning to <Location>Baghdad</Location>, Al-Jader accepted the deanship at the <Organization>Institute of Fine Arts</Organization> where he stayed for several years. In 1962 under the supervision of the president of <Organization>Baghdad University</Organization>, he founded the <Organization>Academy of Fine Arts</Organization> along with his colleagues Dr. Aziz Shalal Aziz and Dr. As&apos;ad Abdul Razak, and later worked as its dean. Through these administrative activities, Al-Jader demonstrated his engagement in the development of an institutionalized form of art education in <Location>Iraq</Location>. Concurrent with his academic positions, Al-Jader served as chair of the <Organization>National Committee</Organization> for Plastic <Organization>Art</Organization> with <Organization>UNESCO</Organization>.
Al-Jader was equally dedicated to his own artistic practice. His style throughout is so consistent that taken together they amount to a vision of <Location>Iraq</Location>. His loose, rough brushstrokes are accentuated by his use of contrasted, vibrant colors. Al-Jader&apos;s markets, streets, and villages are rendered with frenzied daubs of thick paint, making the canvas pulsate with latent energy. The human figures that populate his scenes are part of this rhythm as they conduct their daily lives. Their vitality merely adds to an already dynamic landscape. Although this dynamism was ever-present in Al-Jader&apos;s work, it reached a fever pitch in his later paintings with his scenes almost completely abstracted by conflicting strokes of the paintbrush. The seeming chaos of Al-Jader&apos;s canvases belies an underlying organization that hints at the precision with which the artist executed his canvases. Each color swath is deliberate in application and each figure is carefully placed to create an expert composition.
Al-Jader participated in many important artists&apos; societies, including the Pioneers, the Impressionists, and the <Organization>Society of <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> Plastic</Organization> Artists. He also spent time as the head of the <Organization>Society of <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> Artists</Organization>. The painter was also a prolific exhibitor participating in several group exhibitions all over the world. These included Al-Wasiti Festival, the first Arab Biennale, and shows in <Location>Paris</Location>, <Location>Cairo</Location>, <Location>Brussels</Location>, <Location>Berlin</Location>, the <Location>United States</Location>, <Location>India</Location>, <Location>Poland</Location>, and <Location>Russia</Location>. He also mounted a number of one-man exhibitions in <Location>Baghdad</Location> (1955, 1957), <Location>Berlin</Location> (<Date>1959</Date>), <Location>Prague</Location> and <Location>Bucharest</Location> (<Date>1960</Date>), <Location>Denmark</Location> (<Date>1965</Date>), and <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location> (<Date>1968</Date>). Thus his work was both domestically and internationally visible.   
Al-Jader is valued as a meticulous painter. He also demonstrated this thoroughness in his administrative duties. He was known to have held his students and faculty to a very high standard, a standard that he no doubt applied to himself. His work can be appreciated <Date>today</Date> at Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location> and the <Organization>Jordan National</Organization> Gallery of Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> in <Location>Amman</Location>.

In her photographic works, Lamya Gargash explores interiors as a framework for revealing issues of culture and identity in the <Location>UAE</Location>, set within the context of rapid external change.
The Majlis, exhibited in the <Date>2009</Date> <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization>, is a series of photographs focusing on the room inside the home where people traditionally gather to socialise. Her images reveal the spatial formalities of the majlis, how individuality is expressed through each subject&apos;s interpretation of this domestic space and how the evidence of globalisation and urban change is manifest within it. The photographs document these interiors as moments, frozen in time.
Gargash was the featured artist in the <Location>UAE</Location>&apos;s first national pavilion at the <Organization>Venice Biennale</Organization> (<Date>2009</Date>) where she presented her photographic series Familial, a visual play on the notion of hospitality and the politics of interior design.

Her grandiose and often humorous schemes clash with the gravity expected from works commenting on the region.

"Lawrence Abu Hamdan ,http://galerinon.com/lawrence-abu-hamdan</Address> 
<Location>London</Location> based artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan’s work attempts to measure the contemporary relationship between listening and politics, borders, human rights, testimony, truth and international law, through the production of longer narrative audio documentaries and essays, audio-visual installations, graphic design, sculpture, photography, workshops and performance.
His work with sound and its intersection with politics originates from a long running engagement with DIY music and events and out of this developed an approach to the politics of amplification which borrows from many disciplines. Most recently the artist has been formally engaged with the radio documentary/essay working on a trilogy of works with radio producer Russel Finch which attempt to inhabit, appropriate and push the limits of audio aesthetic practice and journalism.

Continuously commuting between the worlds of <Location>Iran</Location> and <Location>Europe</Location>, Leila Pazooki mainly explores the concept of „borders“. Working with digital media, video and image editing, Pazooki began her early research by experimenting with visual modifications, challenging the „borders“ of visual work in terms of „acceptabillity“; the „licit“ and the“ illicit“ images.
In her series’ <Location>Tehran</Location> Fashion and more recentlyTwo Minute Photo, the artist apprehends the borders between the artist and the people who have casually been filmed or photographed in a urban context. Through mutual contemplative observation, she strives to blur what is to be understood as a barrier in inter-human relationships.

"Lulwah Al-Homoud,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-lulwahalhomoud.html</Address>
Lulwah Al-Homoud is designing a new path from the roots of our earliest thinking to the present and, who knows, the end or a final idea. She does so without talking and without the help of preachers or diplomats. She simply uses mathematics, Islamic mathematics and mathematics which were there already, to recalculate the essential words of creation. &apos;She calls it The Language of Existence,&apos; somebody wrote, so it is, if she did so. Its alphabet exists of the 99 most beautiful names of Allah, which Al-Homoud is &apos;deconstructing and recallibrating&apos; into patterns reminicent of Islamic geometry. The new patterns interestingly include, from the moment of the first human cell devision, all brothers born before and after Abraham. So we see, believe and calculate her work.
The way in which the artist works, from an understanding that Arabic letters have proportions which represent mathematical codes, is to use these codes to deconstruct or break letters into simpler lines as building material for new geometrical designs. For the computation of the break Al-Homoud went looking for codes by writing on ancient &apos;Vedic squares&apos; from <Location>North India</Location>. Such squares contain a multiplication system, which she altered to fit better the growth and development of humanity. She changed the numerical progression of 1 to 9 in the square&apos;s first row and column to a progression of 1,2,4,6,8,16,32,64 etc in reference to human cells which multiply and grow by devision, as often religions do too. The Vedic square then needs mergers, because like humans it allows no more than one digit in its own cells. So 16 becomes 7, 32 becomes 5 and 64 becomes 10 and then 1. Just one. Try this yourself: numbering 64 religions and then recomputating them into 1. And if you skip the math but employ preachers and diplomats, then you understand why there is art. If just to think of an idea and not immediately abandon it.
The end result of The Language of Existence is a computer generated geometrical design, which was recallibrated from the deconstructed words and silkscreen printed on paper (editions of 20, 118,8 x 89,8 cm). By the end of <Date>2008</Date> the artist could show around 14 finished names of the most beautiful 99 ones. 
Coming from the very different visual tradition of calligraphy Al-Homoud&apos;s art is similar in it&apos;s basic act to what Mondrian or Malevich have done with their western figurative world. Her recallibrated The Last would survive well in the company of Malevich&apos;s ultimate vision <Location>Black Square</Location>.
Al-Homoud is from Riyadh, where she majored in sociology at <Organization>King Saud University</Organization>, and was the first <Origin>Saudi</Origin> to complete a MA at <Organization>Central St Martins College of Art</Organization> and Design in <Location>London</Location>. She has had lessons in calligraphy from Rashid Butt and was inspired by Ahmed Moustafa to learn about a 10th century theoretical system of calligraphy. In <Date>2006</Date> she participated in a <Organization>British Museum</Organization> managed project to have Arab artists work in schools.

Maha Malluh is an artist, born from the traditional region of <Location>Najd</Location>, who has met the challenges of modernity that have come so overwhelmingly to <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. She has exhibited her art since <Date>1976</Date> and has in later years acquired a <Organization>BA</Organization> in <Origin>English</Origin> literature and a Californian certificate in design and photography.
Continuous in her artwork, that started with collages and developed into photograms, is her use of symbolic and real imagery to express her opinion about life in <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. Sometimes loudly, as is the case with her photograms showing &apos;babies&apos; which have titles such as Overpopulation and Bad news. Sometimes less outspoken, when she combines images of traditional make-up tools with modern MacDonalds advertising.
&apos;To control both quality and content,&apos; she writes on her website, she built her own darkroom in <Location>Riyadh</Location> to develop and print her images. They are black and white, but rampant with colour waiting to be seen or just recognized. Sometimes there are limits to what a photogram will show: the ears of Minnie Mouse do not do well in black and white. So we are left with Mickey only. It is The Mouse from her series Capturing Light (<Date>2005</Date>). A <Origin>Saudi</Origin> mouse with <Origin>American</Origin> ears, being fed from two bottles of milk. Captured.
In <Date>2007</Date> Malluh staged an event in Galerie O for which her work was mass produced on bags in a drive not only to capture light but also the eyes and minds of young people and moving them away from Luis Vuitton to ideas of a serious nature. And perhaps the sunset.
Maha Malluh believes that <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location> in this hectic world needs art more than ever to move and arrest the eye - the core business of real artists. (<Date>2009</Date>).

"Mahdi Al Jeraibi,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-mahdialjeraibi.html</Address>
Mahdi Al Jeraibi (<Date>1969</Date>) works as an art teacher in <Location>Mecca</Location> where children write and scratch, but hardly draw on their school desks. Really, I wondered: who or what for 25 years made these children not mix rabbits and automobiles with their doodle writing and daydream scratching? It is what we should do: wonder and ask. It is the artist who wants us to. About the school desks which he collected and presented as readymades for the audience to place on a wall. &apos;ALL WERE HERE,&apos; it read about the desks and note that the exhibition was in <Location>Jeddah</Location> and not in <Location>Mecca</Location>. The artist wants dialogue about our memories. He presumes we can do so in a Socratic manner, disagreeing and convincing each other, using points of reference which work for us all. He wants us to explain and argue about traces of our past, which he simply picks up from the floor or out of the school&apos;s backyard. In a way he wants us to go back in time as if we were to cut off our hair; and then he will collect it and remind us that we will grow it back again, unable to change its colour or substance. It changes only slowly with the passing of generations. So is there no point in painting it for any future? Actually there is. Dark haired people who paint their hair blond, lure their partner&apos;s blond hair genes into changing direction. So I read somewhere in a scientific paper. In the end the dialectic argument aims to convince. But on the rational level, in the educated world, in the world of Mahdi Al-Jeraibi, in the world of <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>&apos;s first conceptual artist, we should be optimistic about the potential of art to achieve faster results. Convincing in Al Jeraibi&apos;s <Location>Mecca</Location> is possible on, well, a moments notice, simply by listening and allowing yourself to be convinced. Of his art perhaps. Of his sombre Zincographs which are as far removed from golden palms in <Location>Dubai</Location> hotels as one can possibly imagine. They are of the moon, rather than of the sun - there is no real zinc involved - shining a dark light on the crossing over of religious rituals of pilgrims, superstitions which survive in <Location>Mecca</Location> and a fear we have of a know known future of using DNA to recreate. The Zincographs are sculptered paintings: large wooden frames in which the artist has fixated hair he has collected of a variaty of people in a thick plate of hot wax. They are reminicent of ancient <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> wax portraits to a conceptual mind only. The hair he used he collected both from anonymous pilgrims - beware of <Location>Mecca</Location> barbers selling clones - and from individuals he knows well and managed to convince. As one of them is said to be his wife, there is a question that arises in the mirror of memories. Will Al Jeraibi, when his wife&apos;s hair is eventually used to clone, be the first Pygmalion to have succeed in giving true life himself to a women of his perfect imagination? We should grant her that. The artist himself is the object of imagination too. The Foundation Al Mansouria who has supported him against the dragons of misunderstanding and disinterest has put him forward as a &apos;model for the quest of the young and serious.&apos; We should grant them that too.

"Manal Al Dowayan,http://nadour.org/artists/manal-al-dowayan/</Address>
In her photographic series and more recently her installations, Manal Al-Dowayan examines the <Origin>Saudi</Origin> identity.&#160; Questions raised by her work concern the female condition, symbols of community loyalties, technological changes and the relationship to the world that these imply.&#160; Her art combines a graphic yet refined aesthetic: elegant portraits of women, neon writing, what would seem glamourous motifs (jewels, doves, tattoos). &#160;But an incongruous element will always be thrown in to disturb these studied seductive scenes: (workman’s tools in the series I am,) or the direct use of a paint bomb and a stencil (And We Had No Shared Dreams).
Manal Al-Dowayan was born in <Date>1973</Date> in <Location>Dhahran</Location>, in the East of <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>.&#160; Whilst studying advanced computing (in <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>, then Boston and <Location>London</Location>), she learnt how to shoot and develop photographs.

Manal Dowayan (<Date>1973</Date>)from <Location>Dhahran</Location> is not the only artist who has enjoyed looking at boats moving on an <Location>Amsterdam</Location> canal as is evident in her photo series <Date>Summer</Date>. She is surely, however, the only such artist who can and will say: I am a citizen of <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>, not speaking on her own behalf, but informing the world of her private experiences in the general context of being a professionally working woman in <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. She does so with several series of black and white photographs of women she meets dealing with their <Origin>Saudi</Origin> heritage and daily life. I am a Mother and I am a Petroleum Engineer are self evident titles in her I am series. Dowayan, being a freelance photographer with an education in information technology, works for an oil company. She is now its creative director. In her series Beyond the veil and The Choice again women pose in front of Dowayan&apos;s camera. The choices Dowayan deals with are not mentioned but shown and numbered. The Choice V shows, for example, a woman in traditional dress holding a tennis racket. Or in Choice II, perhaps the most daring in terms of the question it seems to ask, a female hand holds a pen which has just crossed out a word on a page full of repetition. Her photographs are very popular with collectors, is what I was told by <Organization>Edge of Arabia</Organization>, in which exhibition she participated in both <Location>London</Location> (<Date>2008</Date>) and <Location>Venice</Location> (<Date>2009</Date>). A The Choice photo of a <Origin>Saudi</Origin> woman holding a steering wheel was printed in <Origin>Dutch</Origin> magazine Kunstbeeld as an iconic image of the exhibition, providing well for the notions people have in <Location>the Netherlands</Location> about <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. But, one should also have a look at her close up of feet dancing in <Origin>Spanish</Origin> Scenes and admire simply the elegant black and white forms beyond any context of meaning; fingers that fly like swans and do not point to any future. On the future of art in <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location> however, Dowayan has sound ideas which she expressed in Arab News. She told the paper that there should be more patronage of the arts in the Kingdom itself and not just by a government system of prizes. The country needs homegrown private foundations to sustain the arts and crafts. Says Manal Dowayan, who listens well to King Abdullah. The custodian of mosques said of <Origin>Saudi</Origin> women: that they are citizens of <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. And some of them even travel to <Location>Amsterdam</Location>.

"Marwan Sahmarani,http://www.lawrieshabibi.com/artists/26-marwan-sahmarani/overview/</Address>
Marwan Sahmarani is primarily a painter whose works relate to art history, with its timeless and recurrent themes, but also to contemporary life and to his own experiences. His works draw from both his Western cultural education and to his oriental identity, blending Islamic and  Mesopotamian art and iconography with that of ancient <Location>Greece</Location>, <Location>Rome</Location> and the great masters of the <Location>Western Renaissance</Location>. Diverse themes including politics, sociology, war and sexuality, and allusions to his  cultural background and experience of war and exile are all dealt with in his work. Sahmarani uses oil, ink and  watercolor as his primary mediums of expression and has created a unique language that is at once raw, and bare as it is sumptuous.

"Mohamed Bourouissa,http://nadour.org/artists/mohamed-bourouissa/</Address>
Since <Date>2002</Date>, Mohamed Bourouissa has been developing a fine art photography practice but also drawing and video works deeply rooted in social reality. Primarily working around representations of a contemporary urban environment, the artist is interested in geographical and social spaces usually represented by stereotypes. Suburbs (Périphérique, <Date>2005-2008</Date>), prison (Temps mort, <Date>2009</Date>) or television (the Ecran series, <Date>2007</Date>).
He reformulates the stereotypes into compositions of a great formal rigor, qualified as “emotional geometry” by fellow artist Florence Paradéis. He thus creates images where the strangeness and built up tension prevail, as an alternative to the dominant trend. Inspired by painting (Theodore Géricault, Eugene Delacroix or Caravaggio) and contemporary photography (<Location>Jeff Wall</Location>, Garcia di Lorca), the works of Mohamed Bourouissa function like allegories, tightly interweaving a fictional dynamics with their documentary dimension.
Mohamed Bourouissa was born in <Date>1978</Date> in <Location>Blida</Location>, in <Location>Algeria</Location>. He now lives and works in <Location>Paris</Location>. After graduating in Visual Arts from the Sorbonne, <Location>Paris</Location> I (<Date>2004</Date>) and the photography department of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs de Paris, he trained at the <Organization>Studio National</Organization> des Arts – Le Fresnoy in <Date>2008</Date>-2010.

"Mohammed Ben Ali Rbati,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ben-Ali-Rbati.aspx</Address>
If not the very first, Mohammed Ben Ali Rbati is certainly one of the earliest modern <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> painters. He is often referred to as an easel painter, though he eschewed canvas for watercolors on paper.  Much of the history of modern painting in <Location>Morocco</Location> began with Rbati. Little has been written about him, and much of the information is contextual. It is clear that he received early support by European artists in <Location>Tangier</Location>, where he was based for most of his life. Many European painters came through <Location>Morocco</Location> and especially Tangier in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. <Location>Tangier</Location> was, at the time, an international zone, and was therefore a place conducive to international encounters. In 1903, Rbati became the cook for Sir John Lavery, a portrait painter from <Location>Ireland</Location>, who discovered that Rbati was a talented painter that practiced watercolor painting in his spare time with care and attention to detail. Rbati had his first exhibition at the Goupil Gallery in <Location>London</Location> in <Date>1916</Date>. Although Rbati had no formal arts training, his exposure to painting and the availability of watercolors in <Location>Tangier</Location>, thanks to the sizeable <Origin>British</Origin> population, awakened within him a desire to paint the daily scenes by which he was surrounded. 
Rbati&apos;s figurative watercolors on paper focus on <Location>Tangier</Location>, its Kasbah, and its inhabitants. The paintings depict an extensive cross-section of the local population, showing men gathered around musicians or snake charmers, halqas (story-telling circles) in the Kasbah, and people walking through the streets, as well as scenes in cafes, at festivals, and in lavish interiors. Figures are often simplified and demarcated with clear strokes, the folds of djellabas suggested by well-placed lines, highlighting the brightness of the multiple colors. Many of the watercolors feature large groups of men or women, and the focus is often more on the larger scene than on individualizing details. The geometric lines of city walls, mosques, or intricate geometric tiling contrast with the curved and flowing lines of the figures in their traditional dress. In many examples of Rbati&apos;s work, the plane of the picture is entirely flat, with no reference to dimensionality, and the paintings sometimes include decorative borders. However, there are also numerous examples of watercolors that go beyond a flat plane in order to document more closely the scenes the artist witnessed. In these, shadows are clearly placed under each figure, showing the artist&apos;s experimentation and study into ways of showing light and multi-dimensionality. While often described in terms of the spontaneity of his expression, the varied treatment of the picture plane suggests the artist&apos;s interest in deliberately simplifying the forms as part of a style, not as a default. Rbati consistently signed the front of his canvases, always in Arabic.
Rbati is often left out of histories of painting in <Location>Morocco</Location>, which in general focus more on the latter half of the twentieth century. However, as a 1918 exhibition of easel paintings at the Hotel Excelsior in <Location>Casablanca</Location> suggests, there were visiting and local artists working in <Location>Morocco</Location> through the protectorate era (<Date>1912 - 1956</Date>). There are a few examples of self-taught figurative <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> painters whose works have been preserved. Many of these artists captured daily life and locales, including Abdeslam El Fassi Ben Larbi, who painted daily scenes in <Location>central Marrakech</Location>. Early painting in <Location>Morocco</Location> is not a well-documented field, but Rbati&apos;s place in many national and international collections pays tribute to his important foundational role."

"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx</Address>
In 1953, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat graduated from the <Organization>Institute of Fine Art</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location>. He then travelled to <Location>Rome</Location> to train at the Accademia di Belle Arti, graduating in <Date>1959</Date>. While in <Location>Italy</Location>, he also studied metals at the Instituto di Zaka in <Location>Florence</Location>, specializing in casting bronze. He subsequently taught sculpture at the <Organization>Baghdad Institute of Fine Art</Organization> and the <Organization>College of Architectural Engineering</Organization> at the <Organization>University of Baghdad</Organization>.
During his career, Hikmat was a prolific creator and exhibitor, and an active participant in the growing <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> art scene. He held several solo shows in <Location>Rome</Location>, <Location>San</Location> Remo, <Location>London</Location>, <Location>Beirut</Location>, and <Location>Baghdad</Location>. He also participated in most major national exhibitions in <Location>Iraq</Location>. He was a member of the <Organization>Society of the Friends</Organization> of <Organization>Art</Organization> and later the Al-Zawiya group headed by Faiq Hassan. Significantly, Hikmat was also an influential member of the <Organization>Baghdad Group of Modern Art</Organization> (BGMA). Founded by his teachers and friends, Jewad Selim and Shakir Hassan Al-Said, the BGMA was arguably the most important artist society in modern <Location>Iraq</Location> and was dedicated to the idea that <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s heritage held a preeminent place within its modern art practice.
Hikmat embraced these ideals within his own work, drawing subject matter and stylistic inspiration from medieval Islamic art and literature, as well as from Mesopotamian figuration. A number of his most famous works represent subjects from the well-known collection of Arab folktales, One Thousand and One Nights. One such work is The Fountain of Kahramana that depicts the heroine pouring oil into jars occupied by a number of Ali Baba&apos;s forty thieves. Another is the sculptural duet of Scheherazade and Shahrayar (<Date>1971</Date>). In this representation of the main characters of 1001 Nights, the figures are rendered with robust monumentality and strong, sinuous forms that harken back to Assyrian statuary. 
Along with his own art production, Hikmat also assisted in major public works initiated by other prominent members of the artistic community. Foremost among them was Jewad Selim&apos;s <Location>Monument</Location> of Freedom for which Hikmat assisted and supervised the casting process in <Location>Florence</Location>. He also took over the project when Selim died prematurely in <Date>1961</Date>. Another project was the much contested Arch of Victory which stood for decades as a symbol of Saddam Hussein&apos;s dictatorship. Hikmat completed the massive installation when its original sculptor Khalid al-Rahal passed away in <Date>1987</Date>. Despite the connection to the Hussein regime, any plans to dismantle the installation are still being hotly debated.
In <Date>2003</Date>, just before the invasion of <Location>Iraq</Location>, Hikmat fled to <Location>Amman</Location>, <Location>Jordan</Location> where he continued to work. In <Location>Amman</Location>, the sculptor often played host to prominent musicians, writers, and artists. Although the <Origin>Jordanian</Origin> capital provided him with a haven, as it did for many other <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> cultural figures, Hikmat always felt a strong pull towards his birthplace, often referring to <Location>Baghdad</Location> as a beautiful woman. He returned to <Location>Baghdad</Location> directly after the invasion to find his home much changed. Typical of the cultural destruction sustained in <Location>Baghdad</Location> was the defacement of Hikmat&apos;s prized monument, Scheherazade and Shahrayar, as looters cut off the king&apos;s left hand. The sculptor mourned over the destruction of other public sculptures that he had worked so diligently to complete. These were statues that could not be replaced. He also had to come to terms with the disappearance of close to 150 of his own works, representing the breadth of his career, after the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> <Organization>Museum of Modern Art</Organization> was looted.
Hikmat, acutely aware of his role as a protector of <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s cultural past and present, began a campaign to recover art works that had been looted. He founded the Committee for Recovering <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s Culture with the aim of buying back works that had surfaced on underground markets. Through these efforts, he was able to recover at least 100 works, including Jewad Selim&apos;s Motherhood in <Date>2003</Date>. In this, Hikmat became a mobilizing force amongst his students and colleagues in the preservation of <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s cultural heritage.
His second return to <Location>Iraq</Location>, in <Date>2010</Date>, was at the behest of the mayor of <Location>Baghdad</Location> who wished to commission the sculptor to complete a series of monuments for the city. Hikmat agreed and began work on four new sculptures to be erected in various sites in <Location>Baghdad</Location>. This was to be Hikmat&apos;s last project, yet the sculptor would not live to see it come to fruition. To the sorrow of many, Mohammad Ghani Hikmat passed away <Date>September 12th, 2011</Date> after suffering from kidney failure at the age of 82. His son is overseeing the completion of the monuments that Hikmat began working on before his death.

Mohammed Kamel (<Date>1989</Date>) used to sign his graffiti as &apos;Lion heart&apos; by drawing a lion and a heart. The courage to do unusual things, is what is name stood for, but he didn&apos;t really need a name. His friends would recognize him for the quality of his work. An artist should convey a message, is what he told <Origin>Saudi</Origin> Gazette on winning a prize in <Date>2009</Date> at an organized event of 250 graffiti enthousiasts. Colour sprays only, is how Kamel defines graffiti even though he suggests a historical line back to hieroglyphics. His winning work was a window for an elderly man coming from the past to see - or should it be understand - the changes of his time.

"Mohammed Kazem,http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/mohammed-kazem</Address>
Mohammed Kazem was born in <Location>Dubai</Location>, <Location>UAE</Location>, in <Date>1969</Date>. A trained musician as well as an artist, Kazem studied painting at the <Organization>Emirates Fine Arts Society</Organization>, in <Location>Sharjah</Location>, <Location>UAE</Location>, attended <Organization>Al Rayat Music School</Organization>, in <Location>Dubai</Location>, and recently received his MFA at the <Organization>University of the Arts</Organization>, <Location>Philadelphia</Location>, <Location>PA</Location>. A pioneering conceptual artist, influenced by his close friend and mentor Hassan Sharif, his work touches on current global transformations in the social, political, and natural environments, and explores abstract ideas about the body, movement, space, and the natural elements. Kazem often works on simultaneous projects over extended periods of time, observing the transformations of his surroundings and the effects of time. In his photographic series Photographs with Flags, Kazem photographs himself next to flags in the desert that mark imminent construction projects, the artist’s body and physical presence bearing witness to the social and environmental change about to occur. Similarly, Kazem’s Window series documented the construction of a high-rise building from his window over the course of two years, as it slowly began to block his view and even the sky. Even within his iconic scratch paintings, time, space, and the body are all present. Since <Date>1990</Date> Kazem has been scratching the surface of paper in varying abstract compositions, capturing and incorporating sound, light and movement embodied on the page, which also changes and is dependent on the changing light of its surroundings.‘I am fascinated by collecting and documenting information about seemingly unimportant objects, traces of our present, within a particular environment,’ the artist writes.
Kazem’s exploration of his surroundings involves categorization and measurement of the unquantifiable, extending to his frequent use of GPS as a medium for recording. 
Selected to represent the <Location>United Arab Emirates</Location> in <Date>2013</Date>’s <Location>Venice</Location> Biennial, the artist presents an immersive video and GPS installation of his ongoing series Directions, in which the viewer stands at the center of a room surrounded by a moving projection of the sea. Curator Reem Fadda describes it as “intended to recreate an immersive experience of what it is to be lost at sea, to what the waters unafraid, to cross the physical barriers and roam the borders of ideas freely.”"

"Mohammed Melehi,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Melehi.aspx</Address>
Mohammed Melehi studied at the <Organization>École des Beaux-Arts</Organization> (<Date>1953 - 1955</Date>) in Tétouan, <Location>Morocco</Location>, before leaving to study abroad at the École supérieure des Beaux-<Organization>Arts</Organization> Isabel de Hungria (<Date>1955</Date>) in <Location>Seville</Location>; the École supérieure des Beaux-<Organization>Arts</Organization> <Location>San Fernando</Location> (<Date>1956</Date>) in <Location>Madrid</Location>; the <Organization>Académie des Beaux-Arts</Organization> (<Date>1957 - 1960</Date>) and the Instituto Statale d&apos;Arte (<Date>1960</Date>) in <Location>Rome</Location>; the École nationale des Beaux-<Organization>Arts</Organization> (<Date>1960 - 1961</Date>) <Location>Paris</Location>; and finally was a recipient of the <Organization>Rockefeller Foundation</Organization> scholarship to study at <Organization>Columbia University</Organization> (<Date>1962</Date>) for two years before returning to <Location>Morocco</Location> in <Date>1964</Date>.
Melehi became a professor of painting, sculpture and photography at the <Organization>École des Beaux-Arts</Organization> of <Location>Casablanca</Location> (<Date>1964 - 1969</Date>), at that time directed by Farid Belkahia. Melehi, along with Belkahia and Mohammed Chebaa, formed the <Location>Casablanca</Location> group with an exhibition in <Location>Rabat</Location> in <Date>1966</Date>. In addition to a new modernist style in their personal work, the group was also known for a pedagogy that focused on rooting modernism in local visual culture. In 1969, these artists as well as other professors from the <Organization>Casablanca École des Beaux-Arts</Organization> organized the &quot;exposition manifeste,&quot; an outdoor exhibition in Djemaa al-Fna in <Location>Marrakech</Location> in order to connect to a larger public outside of official exhibition spaces.
Beyond his painting, the breadth of Melehi&apos;s career has been striking, in his teaching, publishing, and policy roles, and as a graphic designer. His poster for the 1966 <Location>Rabat</Location> exhibition is currently in the collection of the <Organization>Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>New York</Location>. Melehi was an active member of the group associated with the leftist cultural journal Souffles <Date>from 1966 to 1969</Date>, and designed its original iconic cover. <Date>From 1972 to 1977</Date>, Melehi was founder and director of the cultural journal Intégral. In <Date>1974</Date>, he co-founded and became the director of the publishing house Shoof. In <Date>1978</Date>, Melehi and Mohammed Benaïssa co-founded the Al Mohit association and the Cultural Moussem of Asilah, an arts festival known for its outdoor murals that continues to be held every year. Melehi was arts director at the <Organization>Ministry of Culture</Organization> (<Date>1985 - 1992</Date>) and Cultural Consultant to the <Organization>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</Organization> and <Organization>Cooperation</Organization> (<Date>1999 - 2002</Date>) in <Location>Morocco</Location>. 
Melehi is known as a leading modernist in <Location>Morocco</Location>. Since <Date>the 1960s</Date>, he has been elaborating a body of work based around the recurrent motif of waves. The canvases are consistently hard-edged and optic abstractions – the lines are clean, the colors are clearly delineated, and the brushstrokes and movements of the paintbrush are not visible. The waves themselves are often reconfigured, turned vertically to become flames, or cutting across the canvas on an angle. The waves have been linked to the waves on the beaches of Asilah, Melehi&apos;s hometown, the gesture of writing Arabic calligraphy, and, in their meditative consistency, to transcendence and prayer. Over time, he has stayed constant to this project, reconfiguring similar elements in his research into color and form, while continually varying small details, orientation, and color combinations, as well as adding other abstract shapes or symbols. He has also re-worked his waves in other media, as in a sculpture in <Location>Mexico</Location> in <Date>1968</Date> for the International Meeting of Sculptors, in posters and murals, or integrated into architectural projects.
Melehi has exhibited widely both nationally and internationally. He was part of significant early exhibitions of <Origin>Moroccan</Origin> modernism, including the second Alexandria Biennale (<Date>1958</Date>), the first and second editions of the Biennale des Jeunes in <Location>Paris</Location> (1959, 1961), and the Festival of Negro <Organization>Arts</Organization> in <Location>Dakar</Location> (<Date>1966</Date>). He was also involved in significant pan-Arab exhibitions including the Al-Wassiti Festival in <Location>Baghdad</Location> (<Date>1972</Date>) and the <Organization>PLO</Organization> &quot;International <Organization>Art</Organization> Exhibition for <Location>Palestine</Location>&quot; (<Date>1978</Date>). He has had numerous solo exhibitions including those at the national gallery, Galerie Bab Rouah, in <Location>Rabat</Location> (1965, <Date>1997</Date>), the <Organization>Bronx Museum</Organization> in <Location>New York</Location>, and a retrospective at the <Organization>Institut du Monde Arabe</Organization> in <Location>Paris</Location>, as well as at Galerie L&apos;Atelier (<Location>Rabat</Location>) and the <Organization>Sultan Gallery</Organization> in <Location>Kuwait</Location>. He was a guest of honor at the 3rd <Location>Sharjah</Location> Biennale in <Date>1997</Date> in the <Location>UAE</Location>."

"Mona Hatoum,http://www.sharjahart.org/people/people-by-alphabet/h/hatoum-mona</Address>
Hatoum’s work is an outstanding example of the interweaving of ethical, political and aesthetic issues, whose beauty lies in the wit, economy, risk-taking and even mischief-making with which these issues are conflated . . . .In Hatoum’s deceptively simple works, defiance cannot easily be separated from vulnerability, order from chaos, beauty from revulsion, the brain from the body, the self from the other, affirmation from negation, form from content, light from dark.
Guy Brett, Itinerary, Contemporary Artists: Mona Hatoum, <Organization>Phaidon Press</Organization>, <Date>1997</Date>
Born into a Palestinian family in <Location>Beirut</Location> in <Date>1952</Date>, Hatoum relocated to <Location>Europe</Location> in <Date>1975</Date> when the outbreak of civil war in <Location>Lebanon</Location> during a visit to <Location>London</Location> unexpectedly prevented her return. A practicing artist since <Date>the 1970s</Date>, Hatoum works with a wide and often unexpected range of materials and mediums to explore issues that often have conflict at their core. Political, emotional and even aesthetic conflicts are summoned up by Hatoum’s uncanny transformations of the materials and objects of daily life.
This is seen in work such as Marble Slicer, a giant egg slicer with a human sized bowl exquisitely rendered in white marble and steel (<Date>2002</Date>), Cage-a-deux, an oversized birdcage for human occupation (<Date>2002</Date>) and her more recent work Nature morte aux grenades, where a rolling steel hospital table is covered with colourful and tempting glass ornaments all in the shape of hand grenades (<Date>2006-07</Date>). Political issues underlie the three map works she has shown in <Location>Sharjah</Location>. Included in the 8th <Organization>Biennial</Organization> in <Date>2007</Date> was Hot Spot (<Date>2006</Date>), a human-scaled steel globe where continents marked in red neon glowed like heated iron, and Projection (<Date>2006</Date>), a delicately drawn wall map adopting the more accurate ‘Peters’ projection of the world. In Disorientations II, Hatoum recreated her haunting <Date>1996</Date> work Present Tense, in which the cantonized pockets of Palestinian territory that emerged from the map of the <Date>1993</Date> <Location>Oslo</Location> Accords are represented by bars of <Location>Nablus</Location> soap. 
One of the most internationally recognised of artists from the <Location>Middle East</Location>, Mona Hatoum studied at the <Organization>Byam Shaw School of Art</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>1975-79</Date>) and the <Organization>Slade School of Art</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>1979-1981</Date>).

"Mouna Karray,http://nadour.org/artists/mouna-karray/</Address>
The photographer Mouna Karray strives to make places and everyday objects “speak”. Should her chosen medium halt “at the surface” of things ontologically, the artist seeks to restore the complexity of the spaces that she encounters (be they domestic or urban, private or public) by going beyond superficial appearance and definition. In order to document the” real”, but above all to make the sense and identity of it apparent, the artist works in series. This exploratory method allows for expansion: from motivation to context, from anecdote to memory. On several occasions, in order to tackle the sensitive territory of the personal, Mouna Karray has expanded into other media: for example in the installation El’mech’ed, <Date>2004</Date> and the sound piece An object on the Shore, <Date>2007</Date>.
Born in <Location>Sfax</Location> (<Location>Tunisia</Location>) in <Date>1970</Date>, Mouna Karray studied cinema and photography in <Location>Tunis</Location> (<Date>1989-1993</Date>) and in <Location>Tokyo</Location> (<Date>1997-2002</Date>). During her time in <Location>Japan</Location> her work followed an autobiographical route, with notably the series <Location>Tokyo</Location> my Love (<Date>2001</Date>) and Identity at Stake (<Date>2002</Date>, current).

"Mounira Al Solh,http://www.sharjahart.org/people/people-by-alphabet/s/solh-mounira-el</Address>
The work of Mounira Al Solh is playfully conceptual. Al Solh makes videos, installations, magazines, photographs, paintings and performances. Starting from the personal, or the autobiographical, the work stretches to open up specific micro-social and micro-aesthetic questions, masking back and concealing the personal and the autobiographical. She frequently reflects on specific artworks, by appropriating them and studying them carefully, and often metamorphoses into other characters, such as various other “selves”. In Past of the Coming Days, the <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization> (<Date>2009</Date>) <Organization>Performance &amp; Film Programme</Organization> she presented The Sea is a Stereo, an ongoing project comprising video and installation.

Muhamad Haider is a painter from <Location>Jeddah</Location> and president of the <Origin>Saudi</Origin> <Organization>House</Organization> of Artists. His work can be seen in galleries on his personal website. There is also a list of selected group and solo exhibitions since <Date>1999</Date> both at home and abroad. The galleries on his website show a variety of approaches to the art of catching our eye, that the artist used over changing periods of time. In the first gallery are images of his early works which were made before <Date>1999</Date> when he was endeavouring to paint reality. Then his second gallery (<Date>1999-2001</Date>) is more interesting. While some <Origin>Saudi</Origin> artists seem to make this conscious decision to paint in an abstract style, it is evident from his work that Haider went to the <Location>Jeddah</Location> coastline and bathed his eyes in the chaotic behavior of waves that meet the shore. From this his painting may have turned to abstraction by a longing to join the swim. Great painters like William Turner would have given a nod of approval. But this avenue Haider did not pursue for long. In <Date>2002</Date> he turned into the desert with a style of slight abstraction with references to <Origin>Saudi</Origin> traditions and religion. What abstraction is there in an Arab horseguard, but for speed and what more abstraction is needed than the truth in an image of Kaaba? After <Date>2005</Date> Haider leaves this style again and comes up with a range of experiments. But he keeps with him his deconstruction of a traditional ornament. Have a look at the journey of the triangles in his paintings and how the black ones keep their distance and stick together.

"Nargess Hashemi,http://ivde.net/artists/nargess_hashemi/biography</Address>
The works of Nargess Hashemi are intimate observations of the dualities that permeate her daily existence in <Location>Iran</Location> using a diverse range of techniques and materials including monoprinting, macramé, graph paper and acetate.
Hashemi’s style has developed from the largely figurative works depicting intimate, domestic and celebratory scenes of her earlier series to her most recent work in which she uses graph paper to experiment with more abstract, geometric compositions. Despite this new direction the central themes of the artist’s work remain. Her preoccupation with the familial routines and habits that she has grown up with are always evident in her work, they reflect a conflicted sense of belonging and detachment, nostalgia and uneasiness, comfort and entrapment.
The use of pattern is another dominant element almost always present in Hashemi’s work. From the kitsch wrapping paper used as the background in her Wrap Me Up in You Series, to the complex bands of repetitive, brightly coloured shapes occupying the minute 1 mm x 1 mm squares of graph paper in her Home and Carpet series, she uses pattern in its many varying forms as both literal and abstract manifestations of the influence of environment and tradition.
The artist grew up in a traditional household and studied Ancient Persian at the <Organization>Neyshabour Institute</Organization> and <Organization>Fine</Organization> <Organization>Art</Organization> at <Organization>Tehran University</Organization>. Afterwards she went on to show her work in several solo shows in <Location>Tehran</Location> including at Mah <Organization>Art</Organization> Gallery and Aaran Gallery. She has also exhibited in <Location>France</Location> with <Origin>Iranian</Origin> Spring (<Date>2004</Date>), an exhibition of six artists who are inspired by the art of Persian miniature painting and poetry selected by the <Organization>Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art</Organization>, and in the <Location>US</Location>, a touring group show entitled Wishes and Dreams: <Location>Iran</Location>’s New Generation Emerges (<Date>2007</Date>).

For Nasir Nasrallah, making art is about experimenting with and synthesising materials, whether physical objects or ideas. His work is a highly personal response to the people and places he comes across, using the objects that he collects: toys, buttons, paper, wood and pieces of hardware. The final result is an intellectual recycling of industrial, consumerist components into a work of art.

"Nicky Nodjoumi,http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/nicky-nodjoumi</Address>
Born in Kermanshah, <Location>Iran</Location> in <Date>1942</Date>, Nicky Nodjoumi experienced the Islamic Revolution of <Date>1979</Date> from the perspective of a young artist, astutely aware of the political and social upheavals of this tumultuous period in <Location>Iran</Location>’s history. Earning a Bachelor’s degree in art from <Organization>Tehran University of Fine Arts</Organization> before relocating to the <Location>United States</Location> in <Date>the late 1960s</Date>, Nodjoumi received his Master’s degree in Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> from The <Organization>City College of New York</Organization> in <Date>1974</Date>. Returning to <Location>Tehran</Location> to join the faculty of his alma mater, Nodjoumi joined his politically galvanized students in their criticism of the Shah’s regime, designing political posters inspired by the revolutionary spirit sweeping the country, only to be exiled once more in the aftermath of the revolution. This political engagement has continued to the present day. His nuanced figurative paintings engage in political discourse with a light, satirical touch, layering his personal heritage and lived experiences in <Location>Iran</Location> and the <Location>United States</Location> into scenes that resonate beyond specific historical contexts or geographical boundaries.
Nodjoumi’s works are conceived of as theatrical stages, where compositions of figures both serious and ridiculous, in the words of Phong Bui, “house meanings without irony, narratives without stories, humor without morality, above all creating a space that heightens the awareness of old and new history.” Serious in subject matter and witty in execution, these rich and diverse characters enliven Nodjoumi’s narratives and allude to collective experiences underpinned by socio-political struggles, articulating the full spectrum of feelings from aggression to victimhood. Nicky Nodjoumi&apos;s works are in several prominent collections worldwide, including the <Organization>Metropolitan Museum of Art</Organization> in <Location>New York</Location>, the <Organization>British Museum</Organization> in <Location>London</Location>, the <Organization>Depaul Art Museum</Organization> in <Location>Chicago</Location>, and the <Organization>National Museum of Cuba</Organization>.

"Ninar Esber,http://nadour.org/artists/ninar-esber/</Address>
Based on personal experience –of womanhood but also coming from a certain elevation and slow languor –Ninar Esber’s work touches profoundly upon the notion of identity whilst tracing a poetic vision of the world. The artist uses the human body as an element to support a collective symbolism, made to work in relation to architecture and everyday objects in order to play on the notion of context, in the social, interpersonal even political sense of the term. In her photographs, videos and performances, the sensuality which runs through her work questions genres, morality and their authority. Thus, she makes use of stereotypes in order to better criticize them: the pin-up and the <Location>Hollywood</Location> star (the performance On the Rooftop of Kom Ghrab in <Date>2008</Date>, the series of photographs NMM and also Pin-up) superheros (FEMALE, <Date>2009</Date>), cultural symbols (Colours, Arlesienne), etc.

Niyaz Azadikhah (b. <Date>1984</Date>, <Location>Tehran</Location>) lives and works in <Location>Tehran</Location>.
Azadikhah creates wry, graceful commentaries on life in modern-day <Location>Iran</Location>. In her animations, doll-like figures of chador-clad women slowly morph and mutate, rosary beads bloom into flowers and bikini-clad women wrestle on a barren beach of blank paper. As each tightly-controlled frame unfurls, Azadikhah illustrates her observations on a patriarchal ideology and futile behavioral patterns.
In Line 1, for instance, Azadikhah takes us inside the women’s carriage of the <Location>Tehran</Location> metro. The scene centers around an itinerant underwear seller touting her wares to the women, who respond with varying degrees of interest. All are unified in their appearance, yet she highlights the internal desires and attitudes that make each an individual. The subtleties of this scene offer Azadikhah’s observations on human nature and the social structures we operate within.
Azadikhah has participated in the exhibitions What Lies Beneath I (<Date>2011</Date>) and <Location>Nice</Location> Drawings (<Date>2015</Date>) at <Organization>Gallery Isabelle van den Eynde</Organization>. She has also participated in exhibitions at Jorjani <Organization>Gallery</Organization>, <Location>Tehran</Location> (<Date>2014</Date>), Parallel <Location>Vienna</Location> (<Date>2013</Date>), The <Location>Garden</Location> of Eden at <Organization>Palais de Tokyo</Organization>, Galerie <Location>Utopia</Location>, <Location>Paris</Location> (<Date>2012</Date>), and was a finalist in the <Organization>MOP</Organization> CAP prize in <Date>2011</Date>."

Together they are reminicent of the four fingers of a hand. They are a little less than life size and are made of marble aggregate and polyester resin and are completely black. In preparation of the work, named Humbly and devout, she made study photographs of young girls in abaya. It is how the figures in this group are linked together that is unusual and special to her: the act of prayer. (<Date>2009</Date>).

Noura Bouzo (<Date>1983</Date>) says her art is about the notion of not belonging, but it appears even more to be an effort to negotiate the terms of her desired homecoming. She may not be much different from the unlikely Polar man who returns from a desert journey bringing a well packed camel on to the ice. There is both danger and duality in such a venture. When the ice melts, all of home will drown with the camel. When the ice holds, the camel may freeze but the packs, they might be saved.

She is both an artist and a creative director for an <Origin>English</Origin> language lifestyle magazine. <Organization>Oasis Magazine</Organization> covers &apos;what&apos;s hot and happening in <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>&apos; and may include such serious items as <Organization>Harvard Business School</Organization> icon Michael Porter adressing the Global Competitiveness Forum <Date>2009</Date> on the ability of <Origin>Saudi</Origin>&apos;s to establish a business. Bouzo will know as she is one of the co-founders of the magazine, which reported the forum as being about: &apos;responsible competitiveness.&apos;
Just add snow (<Date>2007</Date>) is the painting that lend its title to an exhibition of her work in a place called DNA in <Location>Riyadh</Location>.

It will serve to move the dancer&apos;s eye from ancient competitiveness to; well first a little snow and then perhaps to <Location>Kilimanjaro</Location>. Adding only Porter, will just not help.

She has a very adequate website and will share her appreciation of modern art and acclaimed female artists by posing with a Tate mug in front of photos of Frida Kahlo while using the colour orange to connect herself to both.Now looking at her galleries on line there are a number of sets to be seen, starting with her &apos;first exhibition&apos; in <Date>2001</Date>, which is like a blue group and then a year later there is a red group. Like the groups in the following years they seem to fit a scheme of abstraction and traditional symbols in which Hejazi was not the only one working in <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. Countries do have collective ideas about art. Judging from her online gallery from around <Date>2006</Date> the artist seems to express stronger opinions of her own design. There is more colour, more detail. And more tension, as can be seen in Missing Tattoo, the large (150 x 150 cm) painting illustrated here at the top, which works well on many levels of focus. The etching of the question mark measures only 10x10 cm and remember that Arabs read from right to left.Some of Hejazi&apos;s best paintings are part of a permanent collection by the name of Segia in <Location>Riyadh</Location>.

"Oraib Toukan,http://nadour.org/artists/oraib-toukan/</Address>
Oraib Toukan works across media in photography, video, text and installation, often using politics and current affairs as source material. She often presents wry and playful critique in the form of subtle interventions with institutions ranging from Wikipedia to Christie’s.
Her works tend to start-off from appropriating a singular map, document, letter, found footage or a photograph. She directly draws from real life instances where absurdity is, or becomes the form. For example in The New(er) <Location>Middle East</Location> (<Date>2007</Date>) she appropriated known topographical works and replaces their mere representational qualities with interactivity. She literally cuts up what has become almost iconographic territory based on a found <Location>US</Location> army map, into new strange magnetic forms for audiences to piece back together on a magnetic wall. Instead, even stranger new territories are formed by them. For another two years, and inspired by ideas of mimicry, she likewise coached real life experts into interviews, corporate presentations, and advertising proposals for selling whole nation states under a company called <Organization>Nayruz Holdings</Organization>.
Oraib Toukan was born in <Location>Boston</Location> in <Date>1977</Date> and was raised in <Location>Amman</Location>, <Location>Jordan</Location> where she has lived most of her life. She has interdisciplinary degrees in <Organization>Geography and Information Systems</Organization> (MSc) combined with Fine Arts and Photography (MFA) from <Organization>Bard College</Organization>. In <Date>2008</Date> she received a full two-year Fellowship Award from Jacob Javitz, as well as MAWRED, YATF, and AFAC production grants for work on trying <Location>Lebanon</Location> and <Location>Israel</Location> for food theft, auctioning off nation states instead of art objects, and re-presenting diplomatic gifts from Arab states to the people of <Location>Israel</Location>.

"Pantea Rahmani,http://nadour.org/artists/pantea-rahmani/</Address>
Born in <Date>1971</Date>, Panthea Rahmani studied visual arts at the <Organization>University of Teheran</Organization>, her birthplace. From this time on, inspired by Balthus, Giacometti or Modigliani, the artist developed an interest in portraits, which she has been producing through painting or drawing.
Her work illustrates a visual quest for the expression of space, shapes or chromatics. In a tension connecting fullness and vacuity, the absence of decors, the quasi-monochromic aspect of her pallet and the stiff attitude of the model, characterize her portraits. Beyond any representation restraining her practice to clichés or stereotypes inherent to her <Origin>Iranian</Origin> identity, the artist asserts herself through an intimate approach. With the representation of her own body on monumental canvases that could be readily mistaken for pencil drawings, Panthea Rahmani invites us to an inner journey to discover oneself.
Shown in many personal exhibitions in <Location>Iran</Location>, her work is also being diffused on the <Organization>European and International</Organization> scenes, particularly in <Location>Portugal</Location>, <Location>Hungary</Location> and <Location>Belgium</Location>, where it has been included in group shows. The works of Panthea Rahmani have notably been exhibited at the Museum of contemporary art in <Location>Teheran</Location>, in Museu da Agua in <Location>Lisbon</Location> as well as the Palacio da Bolsa in <Location>Porto</Location>. It has also been part of several bienniales of drawing or painting in her native land.

"Pascal Hachem,http://nadour.org/artists/pascal-hachem/</Address>
The work of Pascal Hachem, whether through performances or installations, often starts with a diversion. Trained as an engineer, his knowledge of engines and materials give him a particular stance which he applies in creating artefacts and (often mechanized) installations. He uses daily objects and manages to extract their nature and their primary identity thanks to unusual associations and layouts. These machines inevitably cause a feeling of strangeness but paradoxically appear strangely familiar to whoever looks at them. A series of hammers slowly destroying a wall in a paced and almost liturgical motion, a t-shirt gradually torn under the weight of an accumulation of sand, knives gently emerging from a desert. These devices all unsettle the viewer whilst entailing issues of a political, social or environmental nature.

"Pouran-Jinchi,http://www.thethirdline.com/artists/pouran-jinchi/biography/</Address>
Pouran Jinchi is an <Origin>Iranian</Origin>-born, <Location>New York</Location> artist who borrows from her home culture&apos;s traditions of literature and calligraphy to pursue her own aesthetic investigations. Having been trained in calligraphy, she finds the relation between words and forms, natural or non-objective, deeply intertwined. In Pouran&apos;s recent work, viewers will appreciate her increasingly detailed focus on the form of language as subject matter.
Pouran’s work often employs a mixture of calligraphy and abstract expressionism that intertwines Islamic geometry, <Origin>Iranian</Origin> traditions and contemporary aesthetics, with a unique lyricism. Pouran&apos;s early paintings were large scale and heavily layered abstractions, whose flowing lines of saturated color and rolling waves of calligraphy brought to life the form as well as the content of the text to which she was responding. With successive series, Pouran narrowed her focus to single words, repeated over and over to create the very object they signified, or aesthetics distilled from a single letter, emphasizing the building block of language and thought.
The artist&apos;s works are represented in prominent institutional collections such as The <Organization>Metropolitan Museum</Organization>, <Location>New York</Location>; <Organization>Pratt Institute</Organization>, <Location>New York</Location>; The <Organization>Museum of Fine Arts Houston</Organization>; Herbert F.

"Rachid Koraïchi,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Rachid-Koraïchi.aspx</Address>
Rachid Koraïchi began his studies at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in <Location>Algeria</Location> before moving to <Location>France</Location>, where he continued his studies at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, the Institut d&apos;Urbanisme, and the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in <Location>Paris</Location>. Koraïchi&apos;s influences come from <Location>North Africa</Location> and <Location>France</Location>, although he is interested in ideas of shared prehistoric inheritance, and the ways in which the language of art can be universal and carry a global outlook. While Koraïchi is deeply tied to mystic and visual traditions and draws from the spiritual and artisinal heritage of the Maghreb, in his artwork these ideas and systems of communication are reworked to become part of a new artistic project.
Koraïchi comes from a Sufi family from <Location>Algeria</Location>, and his art is often framed within a tradition of Sufi spirituality in which aesthetics and metaphysics are intertwined. Writing and signs, for Koraïchi, hold sacred importance, and calligraphy is often a significant backbone of his work. Drawing from Arabic calligraphy, Koraïchi has created in some ways his own script or graphic language that includes Amazighi and Tuareg letters and mystical symbols. This calligraphy is sometimes legible but often is abstracted with thick repetitions, becoming signs or figures. He has had a long-standing interest in the Sufi poet and scholar Rumi, whose work inspired multiple installations of Koraïchi&apos;s long-term project &quot;The Path of Roses&quot; (Le Chemin de Roses). His work ranges from mystical, abstract works to direct political commentary in dialogue with revolutionary and liberation movements, as in a number of works supporting <Location>Palestine</Location> and the Palestinian people. Koraïchi&apos;s diverse oeuvre encompasses a wide range of artistic expression, from intimate prints to large-scale banners and installations. He works in varied media, including printmaking, paint, ceramics, and textiles.
Beyond Koraïchi&apos;s personal work, collaborations with writers and poets have been an important part of his oeuvre, as with Mohammed Dib, Jamel Eddine Bencheikh, René Char, Michel Butor. He notably collaborated with Mahmoud Darwish on the large scale project of poems and etchings A Nation in Exile (<Date>1981</Date>). A number of Koraïchi&apos;s works have also been executed in collaboration with <Location>North African</Location> artisans trained in traditional techniques, as in dyeing, weaving, or pottery. This collaborative work can be seen in the date-palm plantation in the <Origin>Algerian</Origin> Sahara that Koraïchi has been developing since <Date>2011</Date>. This plantation, conceived of as a kind of large-scale land art, will be ecologically sustainable and devoted to regional culture.​
Koraïchi has exhibited widely internationally, for instance at the 47th and 49th <Location>Venice</Location> Biennales (<Date>1997</Date> and <Date>2001</Date>), &quot;Global Conceptualism&quot; (The <Organization>Queens Museum of Art</Organization>, <Location>New York</Location>, <Date>1999</Date>), &quot;The Short Century&quot; (<Location>Munich</Location>, <Location>Berlin</Location>, <Location>Chicago</Location>, and <Location>New York</Location>, <Date>2001-2</Date>), &quot;Word Into <Organization>Art</Organization>&quot; (The <Organization>British Museum</Organization>, <Location>London</Location>, <Date>2006</Date>), and &quot;The Future of Tradition – The Tradition of Future&quot; (Haus der Kunst, <Location>Munich</Location>, <Date>2010</Date>). He has had a number of solo shows, such as the <Location>Emirates</Location> Palace Auditorium (<Location>Abu Dhabi</Location> Festival, <Location>Abu Dhabi</Location>, <Date>2011</Date>), the Herbert F. <Organization>Johnson Museum of Art</Organization> at Cornell Unversity (<Location>Ithaca</Location>, <Location>New York</Location>), Chapelle Saint Martin, Le Mejan (Arles), La Citadelle (<Location>Algiers</Location>), and <Organization>Darat al Funun (Amman)</Organization>. He also created a stained-glass window for the Chapelle Sainte-Cécile (Ceillac, <Location>France</Location>), and has provided illustrations for a number of publications by writers such as Mahmoud Darwish and Rumi. In <Date>2011</Date>, Koraïchi won the <Location>Victoria</Location> &amp; <Organization>Albert Museum</Organization>&apos;s Jameel Prize, an international prize for contemporary artists inspired by Islamic traditions of craft and design.  Koraïchi&apos;s work is held in a number of major public collections, including the <Organization>British Museum (London)</Organization>, the <Organization>National Museum</Organization> for African <Organization>Art</Organization> (<Location>Washington</Location>, <Location>D.C.</Location>), the Musée d&apos;art Moderne de la Ville de <Location>Paris</Location> (<Location>Paris</Location>), and <Organization>Darat al Funun</Organization>/The <Organization>Khalid Shoman Foundation (Amman)</Organization>."

"Ragheb Ayad,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Ragheb-Ayad.aspx</Address>
Ragheb Ayad was born in <Date>1892</Date> into a <Organization>Coptic</Organization> family in the neighborhood of Faggala in <Location>Cairo</Location>. He received his primary education at the École des Frères before joining the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the year of its creation by Prince Youssef Kamal in <Date>1908</Date>. He was among the first students of this new institution along with artists Mahmoud Mokhtar (<Date>1891 - 1934</Date>), Youssef Kamel (<Date>1891 - 1971</Date>), Antoine Haggar (<Date>1896 - 1962</Date>) and Mohammed Hassan (<Date>1892 - 1961</Date>). After he graduated in <Date>1911</Date>, Ayad worked as a drawing teacher at the <Organization>Coptic Secondary School</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> and made several trips to <Location>France</Location> and <Location>Italy</Location>. <Date>Between 1921 and 1922</Date>, Ayad and his friend, the painter Youssef Kamel, agreed on an exchange; in turns each would work as a teacher for one year to finance the other&apos;s stay in <Location>Italy</Location>. In 1925, both Ayad and Kamel received a scholarship to study at the <Organization>Royal Academy</Organization> of Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> in <Location>Rome</Location> along with their colleague Mohammed Hassan. During that time, Ayad traveled around <Location>Italy</Location> and visited the cities of <Location>Florence</Location>, Sienna and <Location>Venice</Location> where he attended the fifteenth Biennale in <Date>1926</Date>. After obtaining his diploma from the <Organization>Decoration department</Organization> of the <Organization>Royal Academy</Organization> of Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> in <Location>Rome</Location> in <Date>1928</Date>, he returned to <Location>Egypt</Location> the following year.
Ayad was the first to propose the idea of creating an <Organization><Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Academy</Organization> in <Location>Rome</Location> on the model of the other foreign academies established in the <Origin>Italian</Origin> capital. In 1930, He was appointed as the head of the <Organization>Decoration department</Organization> at the <Organization>School of Applied Arts</Organization> in Giza where he remained until 1937. Following this appointment, he became professor and director of the Free section of the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> that offered evening classes to students who had to work during the day. In 1936, he married the <Origin>Italian</Origin> painter Emma Caly (-Ayad), with whom he held several exhibitions in <Location>Egypt</Location>. Ayad also worked as a curator and played an important role in reorganizing the <Organization>Coptic</Organization> museum in <Date>1941</Date>. <Date>From 1950 to 1955</Date>, succeeding Youssef Kamel, he was named director of the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> <Organization>Art</Organization>. During his tenure there, he created a special section in the Museum dedicated to the work of the sculptor Mahmoud Mokhtar, which was inaugurated in <Date>1952</Date>.
Ragheb Ayad is one of the leading painters of a generation of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> artists commonly referred to as the pioneers (al-ruwwād), as they were the first to be educated in artistic institutions established according to European models, such as the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>. Ayad broke away from his academic education at the Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> and in <Location>Rome</Location> to create an original folklorist style that distinguishes him from his contemporaries. Throughout his career, he depicted scenes of rural and popular daily life, such as the market place, the labor in the fields and the popular café, as well as traditional practices rooted in <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> culture, such as the zār, a Nubian ritual trance dance, or the taḥtīb, an ancestral game of stick fighting practiced in Upper <Location>Egypt</Location>. He also painted religious scenes and exterior views of the <Organization>Coptic</Organization> monasteries.
Ayad mastered the art of sketching and besides his oil paintings, he produced numerous sketches and drawings enhanced with watercolors such as gouache. His expressive style is characterized by the vivacity of his textured strokes that express the dynamic of constant movement, as well as by the use of powerful colors. His work is profoundly marked by the arts of Ancient <Location>Egypt</Location>: the formal aesthetic of the decorative bas-reliefs and paintings of the tombs and temples of Thebes inspired him to reinvent the ancient system of superposed narrative scenes, which sometimes led him to use horizontal formats. Towards the end of his career, his style progressively evolved towards a purification of lines and stylization of forms. Ayad was also a skilled decorator and painted several interiors of public and private buildings. In 1935, he executed a series of decorative paintings for the old <Organization>Shepherd Hotel</Organization> that was unfortunately destroyed in the <Location>Cairo</Location> fire in <Date>1952</Date>. He also participated in the interior decoration of religious buildings such as the <Organization>Coptic Cathedral of Sohag</Organization> and the <Organization>Catholic</Organization> Churches of Minia and Samalut.
From the 1930&apos;s, Ragheb Ayad exhibited regularly at the Salon in <Location>Cairo</Location> founded by the <Organization>Society of Fine Art</Organization> Lovers. During his lifetime, he held numerous solo and collective exhibitions in <Location>Egypt</Location> and abroad. His works are exposed at the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> <Organization>Art</Organization>, the <Organization>Agricultural Museum</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the <Organization>Museum of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location> and at Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>.

Rana Begum received her Fine Art Degree in painting at the <Organization>Chelsea College of Art and Design</Organization> and her MFA in painting from the <Organization>Slade School of Fine Art</Organization>, both of <Location>London</Location>.
Lodged between op-art and minimalism, Rana&apos;s previous works drew its inspiration from repetitive geometric patterns within Islamic art and architecture. The result is a series of tightly controlled compositions, where impeccably applied colorful hard-edge lines are coated in a thick layer of glossy resin, to create seductively tactile reflective surfaces. Rana&apos;s works were an exercise in rhythm and symmetry and much like music, had a spiritual quality to them that embraces the heart and gratifies the eye.
In more recent work, Rana&apos;s works draw inspiration from urban visual stimuli such as the abstract clashes of form and colour that can be seen in the city, and combines them with the traditional repetition of geometric form found in Islamic art. To view the work one is required to adjust their position for the work to unravel. As you move, the work reveals a constant shifting symmetry of colour that ripples, brakes, and reforms before your eyes. It is in this visual movement that Rana creates a compelling visual language where by with the tiniest of movements the surrounding chaos aligns itself into a moment of symmetry. 
Rana currently lives and works in <Location>London</Location>, <Location>UK</Location>."

The members of Raqs Media Collective enjoy playing a plurality of roles, often appearing as artists, occasionally as curators, sometimes as philosophical agents provocateurs. The collective makes contemporary art and films, curates exhibitions, edits books, stages events and collaborates with architects, computer programmers, writers and theatre directors. Following its self-declared imperative of “kinetic contemplation” to produce a trajectory that is restless in terms of the forms and methods that it deploys even as it achieves a consistency of speculative procedures, Raqs remains closely involved with the Sarai programme at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, an initiative that the collective cofounded in <Date>2000</Date>.

"Rasheed Araeen,http://www.sharjahart.org/people/people-by-alphabet/a/araeen-rasheed</Address>
b. 1935, <Location>Karachi</Location>, PakistanLives and works in <Location>London</Location>, <Location>United Kingdom</Location>
<Location>London</Location>-based artist, writer and curator Rasheed Araeen began working as an artist while studying Civil Engineering at <Organization>NED University</Organization> in <Location>Karachi</Location>. In 1964 Araeen moved to <Location>London</Location>, and became an early pioneer and practitioner of Minimalism. With no formal training in sculpture, it was his work as a civil engineer and an early encounter with the sculptures of Anthony Caro that influenced the formal language and use of simple or industrial materials characteristic of Araeen’s best-known works.
Yet unlike Caro, Araeen tried to eliminate hierarchy and traditional notions of composition in his work. In early works, such as Sculpture No. 1, conceived in <Date>1968</Date>, steel girders were placed, without a plinth, in a simple grid on the gallery floor. In his later ‘Structures’, he used modular cubes or rectangles that were infinitely repeatable and re-combinable. While reflective of Minimalist aesthetics, Araeen’s work became increasingly participatory as seen in works such a Char Yar (<Date>1968</Date>) where viewers were free to manipulate a series of cubic forms. By <Date>1970</Date>, his growing interest in the performative and participatory possibilities of sculpture was realised with his seminal ‘Chakras’ where the artist and audience tossed a series of disks into the water at St. Katherine’s Docks.
After this time, Araeen’s practice became increasingly politicised. As an activist, Araeen was involved in various groups supporting liberation struggles, democracy and human rights in <Location>Britain</Location> and around the world. In <Date>1978</Date>, Araeen founded the critical journals Black <Location>Phoenix</Location>, Third Text and Third Text <Location>Africa</Location>. These were groundbreaking platforms for the views and ideas of non-Western artists whose works had been largely ignored or marginalised by traditional art institutions and the art establishment. The publications provided a crucial channel for the exchange of ideas among these artists by linking them together as part of a wider collective within the Black diaspora and Black nationalist movement that was prevalent at the time.
In <Date>the late 1980s</Date> Araeen also became known for his work curating influential exhibitions such as The Essential Black Art at the Chisenhale <Organization>Gallery</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>1987</Date>) and The Other Story at the <Location>Hayward</Location> <Organization>Gallery</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>1989</Date>). These exhibitions explored <Location>Britain</Location>’s colonial and post-colonial past and the legacy of racism, inequality and cultural insensitivity that Araeen felt pervaded <Origin>British</Origin> life.
Araeen has exhibited internationally and regionally with significant solo exhibitions including Zero to Infinity, Museo de Arte, <Location>Lima</Location>, <Location>Peru</Location> (<Date>2013</Date>), Before and After Minimalism: Drawings, Painting, Sculpture and Concepts, <Date>1959 - 1974</Date>, Aicon <Organization>Gallery</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>2010</Date>), To Whom It <Date>May</Date> Concern, <Organization>Serpentine Gallery</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>1996</Date>), V Habana <Organization>Biennale</Organization>, <Location>Havana</Location>, <Location>Cuba</Location> (<Date>1994</Date>), Strife and/or Structure, Modern Art <Organization>Gallery</Organization>, <Organization>Fukukoa Art Museum</Organization>, <Location>Fukuoka</Location> Prefecture, <Location>Japan</Location> (<Date>1993</Date>) and From Modernism to Postmodernism: Rasheed Araeen A Retrospective‭, ‬Ikon <Organization>Gallery</Organization>, <Location>Birmingham</Location> (<Date>1987</Date>).

Masharawi describes his work as an attempt to create a ‘cinema’ out of the Palestinian situation. He has produced over fifteen films which include features, shorts and documentaries, and which he feels together constitute a mirror or document of Palestinian life over the <Date>last twenty years</Date>. His feature films include Curfew (<Date>1993</Date>), Haifa (<Date>1996</Date>), and Ticket to <Location>Jerusalem</Location> (<Date>2002</Date>) and his documentaries include Live from <Location>Palestine</Location> (<Date>2001</Date>).

In an installation entitled &apos;<Location>Dubai</Location>: What&apos;s left of her land&apos; — part building site, part abstract sculpture and both chaotic and heroic in its arrangement of pulleys, tools, maps, cement and silhouetted workers — young <Location>Dubai</Location> artist Reem Al Ghaith simultaneously celebrates and critiques the voracious urbanisation of the region.
Louisa Buck
The work of Reem Al Ghaith reflects the ambivalence felt by most Emiratis about the rapid changes that have brought wealth and, particularly for artists, opportunities, but have also resulted in a loss of cultural identity and the rapid destruction of any physical connection to the landscape of the past.
For the 9th <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization>, Al Ghaith recreated a <Date>2008</Date> installation titled <Location>Dubai</Location>: What&apos;s left of her land? The work combined a wide range of media in what was a large-scale and ambitious project.

For over thirty years the artist Robert MacPherson has produced objects and installations in which he exploits the emotive tension between anonymous functional objects and a highly specific, visually allusive language with which they are named, often drawn from Australian working class slang.
Trevor Smith
Long considered an important Australian artist, Robert MacPherson uses the rich and colourful culture of his rural childhood to address the environmental, colloquial and distinctive aspects of Australian landscape and language. Over the course of his career he has worked with text, drawings, paintings, dramatic room-scale installations, objects and sculpture.
His work explores the philosophical propositions of what constitutes a work of art and often incorporates familiar imagery and everyday materials such as road signs, paint brushes, office stationery, shovels and blankets.
For the 9th <Organization>Sharjah Biennial</Organization> Macpherson presented a variety of existing sculptural, installation and painted works covering a period <Date>from 1973 to 1993</Date>. Exhibited across two adjacent spaces in the <Organization>Sharjah Art Museum</Organization> the collected works provided a compelling glimpse into the distinct poetics of Macpherson’s life and work.

"Saâdane Afif,http://nadour.org/artists/saadane-afif/</Address>
In his work, Saâdane Afif favours a playful yet eclectic approach, which he tends to share with other artists from across the spectrum, involving musicians along with critics and writers. His working method is based on the idea of keeping the outcome open to all possibilities throughout the production of the piece, up until the final result. Whilst moving away from a more egotistic approach the artist quotes widely from other artists, involving materials and forms in a transformation cycle which is part of an entire process: his pieces are retrieved in order to be re-interpreted by other artists, in texts, musical scores, live performances, which produces new and dynamic objects which are hard to classify. Saâdane Afif thus maintains a great freedom in his method, swinging between a formal levity and a subtlety with underlying issues.

In the <Date>past 7 years</Date> she has been part of regional and international exhibitions, art residencies and workshops./nIn her new exhibition, Saba Innab moves us with a new experience of forms which seem familiar, yet equally unreasonable in configuration, reminding us of an architectural building in ruins or of a dysfunctional internal structure of human civilizations, all based on something of an illusion. 
 
Conversely, the artwork captures the richness of her paintings through their simplicity, yet the complexity of the details is coated by mystery. This combination takes one into the deep sub consciousness of humanity.

Safeya Binzagr (<Date>1940</Date>) is an artist who presents her work in her own museum. The &apos;Darat Safeya Binzagr&apos; which opened in Jiddah in <Date>2000</Date> celebrates both the <Origin>Saudi</Origin> and <Location>Hijaz</Location> heritage. 
&apos;It is important for Saudis to remember, and for the West to learn. This book will be a record for the new generation,&apos; is how Binzagr introduces <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>, an artist&apos;s view of the past (<Date>1979</Date>). She then writes: &apos;I don&apos;t think that I can live without painting.&apos; She may never have tried. The many colour illustrations of her oil paintings, watercolours, pastels, drawings and etchings are grouped around the themes: marriage, traditional dress, old architecture, religion, daily life and desert life. Illustrated here from the book is a ceremony in which a groom is shaved while his mother places a gold coin on the barber&apos;s forehead and wedding musicians entertain him. A scene from the religion chapter, which the artist will not have witnessed herself, is named Al-Mahmal after a decorated camel litter which was used to ceremoniously carry the Kaaba covering for the Hajj into <Location>Mecca</Location>. The covering used to be presented by <Location>Egypt</Location> and arrived by ship through the Suez canal accompanied by a &apos;Prince of the Hajj,&apos; she writes. Binzagr may have used old photographs to reconstruct this scene as she is reported to have spent much effort to research and collect photographic material from such collections as the <Organization>Royal Geographic Society</Organization> in <Location>London</Location>. She also uses her family as a source and sometimes as a model as she did with her sister for her trademark picture Zabun. The&apos;Safeya&apos;s Mona Lisa&apos; is a portrait of a <Origin>Saudi</Origin> lady in a traditional and unvieled dress that was still common in the 1960&apos;s in the western province of <Location>Hijaz</Location>.
Binzagr was born to a well known merchant family in Jiddah and attended school in <Location>Sussex</Location>, <Location>England</Location>. In the mid 1960&apos;s she started her career as a professional artist with a program of full time art studies in <Location>Cairo</Location>.

"Saloua Raouda Choucair,http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/life-work-choucair/nSaloua</Address> Raouda Choucair is one of the most respected living artists in <Location>Lebanon</Location>, though her work is little known outside of her home country./nShe was born in <Location>Beirut</Location> in <Date>1916</Date>. She learnt to draw and paint under the tutelage of Omar Onsi and Moustafa Farroukh, prominent <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> artists who adopted impressionist and realist styles. A trip to <Location>Egypt</Location> in <Date>1943</Date> sparked her passion for Islamic art and architecture and her conviction – despite the beliefs of her tutors – that Arab artists ‘reached into the essence of the subject, stripping it of all the associated with art since the time of the Greeks until the end of the 19th century.’/nAt the end of <Date>the 1940s</Date> Choucair spent three important years in <Location>Paris</Location> where she absorbed the current themes, trends and philosophies of European modernism. Though she was a student at the <Organization>École des Beaux-Arts</Organization> and attended the studio of the master Fernand Léger, Choucair found like-minded individuals at the <Organization>Atelier d’Art Abstrait</Organization>, a group of artists committed to the pursuit of abstract or non-objective art. The exhibition at <Organization>Tate Modern</Organization> begins with a group of vibrant gouache paintings from this period, showing the artist’s experiments with repeated, modular forms inspired by her love of geometry and mathematics.
Saloua Raouda Choucair Infinite Structure <Date>1963-5</Date>/nSaloua Raouda Choucair
Infinite Structure 1963–5/n&#169; <Organization>Saloua Raouda Choucair Foundation</Organization>/nIn <Date>the late 1950s</Date>, working from her home studio in <Location>Beirut</Location>, Choucair began modelling in clay and carving wood. Her first series of sculptures explores the trajectory of a line. Choucair was interested in the ability of a line to follow a path that allows it to transform itself into numerous shapes. The line and curve are basic elements of the visual language that she used throughout her career, finding its way into a variety of media including painting, sculpture, textiles, murals and other domestic designs./nIn <Date>the 1960s</Date> she worked on a series known as ‘interforms’; simple cubes or blocks housing intricately carved, complex internal forms. This was followed by the series she later titled ‘poems’, modular sculptures with parts that stack together in a flexible way. Each module, like the stanzas of Arabic poetry, may stand alone or be stacked with others to be read as a whole. A further group of works are known as the ‘duals’, having two interlocking parts./nChoucair’s ideas are often worked out across various materials, and forms from her early paintings are repeated in later sculptures and in other items she made to express her belief that art should be a living, architectural reality. The exhibition brings groups of these works together, showing the rich and complex connections between pieces and exploring the artist’s belief in the power of non-objective art. An extensive display of small maquettes that Choucair made throughout her career shows fascinating ‘studies’ that reveal the artist’s impressive creative energy. One of her modular paintings from <Date>the late 1940s</Date> was pierced by shards of shattered glass in the artist’s apartment during a bombing raid in the <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> civil war of <Date>the 1980s</Date>. The object bears witness to that history and the circumstances through which Choucair not only survived, but continued to work with energy and enthusiasm./nThe final room showcases a group of experimental sculptures from <Date>the 1980s</Date> made of aluminium, plexiglass and nylon thread that relate to Choucair’s ambitions to incorporate water and movement into her works./nThroughout <Date>the 1980s</Date> and 90s Choucair received increasing recognition and awards for her work. In <Date>1982</Date> she was commissioned by the <Organization><Origin>Lebanese</Origin> Lions Club</Organization> to create a major public sculpture. The piece was installed at the southern entrance to <Location>Beirut</Location>, but was vandalised and then disappeared completely. Choucair went on to complete further commissions in <Date>the 1990s</Date>, one of which now stands at the Gibran Khalil Gibran <Location>Garden</Location> in downtown <Location>Beirut</Location>./nIn <Date>2011</Date> a major retrospective of her work was held at the <Organization>Beirut Exhibition Center</Organization>. Choucair is now in her 96th year and her daughter is working on the establishment of her Foundation. The curators of the exhibition, Jessica Morgan and Ann Coxon, were given access to Choucair’s archive and the substantial body of work that remains in her <Location>Beirut</Location> apartment. This is the first opportunity to see a broad and fascinating selection of works by Saloua Raouda Choucair finally taking their place in a museum of international modern art.

Alshaibi&apos;s works in photography, video art and sculpture to evoke the language of suffering, displacement and loss. Her poetic and lyrical approach contrasts the depiction of her own history of living in war and the double negation to her familial homelands. Alshaibi often uses her own body in her works to test the limits of access and privilege; infiltrating guarded spaces, negotiating borders and testing the dynamics of power between nation/state and its citizenry. Alshaibi is also interested in the spectrum of control and domination, whether it’s the body’s relationship to land and national identity, or the experience between humans’ competing for resources and power. Whether it&apos;s the threshold of two different existential planes, of disorientation, and spaces between spaces, her work is rooted in the anxieties of the human experience.

The <Origin>Saudi</Origin> Gazette wrote <Organization>Khashoggi</Organization> never lost touch with her conservative roots and that religion and islamic symbolism feature strongly in her art. Most of her paintings are of women with no facial features. They quote the artist: This is not because we dont have a right to speak, or that we dont see enough. It is just going abstract, and the faceless ladies started with the religious restriction on figurative representation and the prohibition of that in Islam. I am not really sure about this; I do portraits, but when I do full figures, I have to miss something out, so it is not complete. I like them being faceless because once I put a face to that, it becomes someone, and I am not talking about someone  I am talking generally about women.&quot;

"Seif Wanly,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Seif-Wanly.aspx</Address>
Mohammed Seif al-Din Wanly was born into an aristocratic family of <Origin>Turkish</Origin> origin on his father&apos;s side, Ismaïl Bey Mohammed Wanly, and of Caucasian origin from his mother, Ismat Hanem al-Daghistani. He grew up with his four sisters and his younger brother, <Organization>Adham</Organization>, in an intellectual francophone environment. They were educated by private tutors in their family house, the Urfan <Organization>Pacha</Organization> Palace located in the neighborhood of <Date>Muharram</Date> Bey in <Location>Alexandria</Location>. Seif worked as a public official at the customs archives of Alexandria and started painting with his brother, <Organization>Adham</Organization>. In 1929, Ottorino Bicchi (<Date>1878 - 1949</Date>), an <Origin>Italian</Origin> painter from <Location>Livorno</Location>, opened a studio in <Location>Alexandria</Location> and the Wanly brothers were among his first students. After Bicchi left <Location>Egypt</Location> in <Date>1934</Date>, Seif and Adham established their own studio in Alexandria the following year together with their friends, the painter Ahmad Fahmi and the filmmaker Mohammed Bayoumi.
During the 1950&apos;s, the two brothers traveled regularly to <Location>Europe</Location> and visited <Location>France</Location>, <Location>Italy</Location> and <Location>Spain</Location> where they sketched and painted numerous scenes of ballet, opera and theater performances, as well as landscapes. When sculptor Ahmad Osman (<Date>1907 - 1970</Date>) established the <Organization>Faculty of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location> in <Date>1957</Date>, Seif was appointed professor within the painting department. In 1959, the <Organization>Ministry of Culture</Organization> commissioned the Wanly brothers along with many artists of their generation, such as Tahiya Halim and Hussein Bikar, to record the architectural heritage of Nubia before its flooding due to the construction of the High Dam in <Location>Aswan</Location>. The same year, when his brother <Organization>Adham</Organization> passed away, Seif lived through a difficult period, which was reflected in his work. At the age of sixty-eight, he married the <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> painter Ihsan Mokhtar. He died in <Date>1979</Date> in <Location>Stockholm</Location> where he was preparing an exhibition of his Scandinavian landscapes.
The Wanly brothers were very close in their life and work. They influenced one another and developed a similar style. Seif only used his first name to sign his paintings while his brother, <Organization>Adham</Organization>, signed them by the name of Wanly or E. Wanly (Edham Wanly). Together, they introduced modern pictorial trends in <Location>Alexandria</Location> and were among the first to depict international subjects, breaking away from the folklorist style of their contemporaries.
Seif was a prolific artist who produced more than a thousand paintings, as well as numerous drawings and sketches. His early works are inspired by the use of the light and gentle strokes of his <Origin>Italian</Origin> professor, Ottorino Bicchi, who was close to the <Origin>Italian</Origin> Macchiaioli and the École de Barbizon. Later in his career, Seif used larger surfaces of bold colors and exercised greater freedom in his compositions, both of which brought him closer to Fauvism. 
Seif was fascinated by the performance arts and depicted scenes of circus, ballet, opera, music concerts, bull-fighting as well as all types of sports​, including horse races. He represented the life of the performers on stage and backstage by expressing their vivid and dynamic movements. His fascination with performance arts also led him to design several sets for theater and opera productions in <Location>Egypt</Location>. He painted numerous views of traditional Nubian villages before they were flooded, as well as many landscapes of <Location>Egypt</Location> and all the countries he visited, including <Location>Spain</Location>, <Location>France</Location>, <Location>Italy</Location>, <Location>Yugoslavia</Location>, <Location>Poland</Location> and <Location>Russia</Location>. Seif is also the author of a series of self-portraits that reflect his sense of humor and derision. Following the death of his brother, <Organization>Adham</Organization>, which affected him profoundly, he introduced a darker palette of colors and shades in his paintings. His works can be seen at the Seif and <Organization>Adham Wanly Museum</Organization> hosted in the villa of the <Organization>Mahmoud Saïd Museum</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location>, the <Organization>Museum of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Alexandria</Location>, the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> Art in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the Mathaf <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>, as well as in numerous private collections around the world."

"Shadi Ghadirian,http://ivde.net/artists/shadi_ghadirian/biography</Address>
Shadi Ghadirian’s photography takes conflicting visual signifiers and drags them into ironic yet subtly unnerving relationships with the viewer. Born in <Date>1974</Date> in <Location>Tehran</Location>, <Location>Iran</Location>, Ghadirian emerged in <Date>2000</Date> among a generation of photographers prepared to tackle the confusing reality of a woman’s place in contemporary <Location>Iran</Location> and to play with understandings of the region. She has exhibited widely, participating in biennales in <Location>Russia</Location>, <Location>Sharjah</Location> (<Location>UAE</Location>); solo exhibitions in the <Location>US</Location> and <Location>India</Location>, and prestigious group shows including ‘Unveiled, New Art From the <Location>Middle East</Location>’ at the Saatchi Gallery, <Location>London</Location>, and the touring Word Into Art exhibition at The <Organization>British Museum</Organization> and <Organization>DIFC</Organization>, <Location>Dubai</Location>.
By placing objects of war into scenes of domestic harmony, Ghadirian’s Nil-Nil comments on the disparity between these two worlds. Some are haunting, such as the bloodstained boots discarded alongside an equally blood red set of high heel shoes, while others veer into absurdity, like the bullets that sit in a make up purse.
Like Everyday is a series of photographs depicting anonymous chador-wrapped figures with kitchen utensils instead of faces. This simple, ominous collision of potent symbols – the veil and domesticity –parodies stereotypical understanding of women of the region and universally. Qajar is a recreation of the photographic compositions and styles of the studio portraits that flourished in the Qajar dynasty, who ruled <Location>Iran</Location> from <Date>1794-1925</Date>. With fierce monobrows and period dress, Ghadirian’s models mimic the photography of that time against a painted background. But clear intrusions of modernity surface in the work, in the form of ghetto blasters and television sets. She lives and works in <Location>Tehran</Location>."

"Shadia Alem,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-shadiaalem.html</Address>
Shadia Alem has a following of admirers among the creative djinns of both the desert of Wadi Abkat and those of the Île de la Cité, where the bells of the Notre Dame at first &apos;confused&apos; her to recite muslim prayers. If ever there is need to imagine a hunchback on the minarets of the Grand Mosque in <Location>Makkah</Location> many djinns will no doubt summon Shadia and her sister Raja to draw and write his grotesque lines with a single pencil to please both ears and eyes. The artist and her novel writing sister were born in <Location>Makkah</Location> and later lived in <Location>Taif</Location> where Shadia as a child is said to have drawn on the doors. By the time she lived in <Location>Paris</Location> Alem had managed to move up to painting landscapes on the tail fin of some <Organization>British Airways</Organization> aircraft.
In <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location> Shadia Alem has been supported by the <Organization>Al-Mansouria Foundation</Organization>. It owns a number of her oils on paper of mysterious and traditionally dressed women of <Date>the early 1990s</Date>. They seem to be part of a series that the artist calls her <Location>Wabar</Location> collection, apparently in reference to a city of <Location>Bedouin</Location> legend, which was destroyed by a destructive wind. Shadia is said to have later turned to landscape painting, before she discovered that the imagination may flow even more freely in less conventional ways. While informing us that Tracy Enim&apos;s Bed spoke to her in <Date>1999</Date>, she turned to making installations. In the <Organization>Kunstmuseum Bonn</Organization> in <Date>2004</Date> she joined a show &quot;Languages of the desert&quot; of artists from <Location>the Gulf</Location> region with an installation Negatives: no more, using dvd, photo and negatives. An installation, Powerless, and two series of photographs, named Compassionate wires and Rain, featured in <Date>2007</Date> in <Location>Bahrain</Location> in a solo presentation at Albareh Art Gallery.
At <Organization>Edge of Arabia</Organization> in <Date>2009</Date> Alem suspended from the ceiling a series of large transparent panels on which in black and white details of the eye was painted much enlarged with her sister&apos;s writing dancing lines around the pupil. Jah Eye: meaning the &apos;beautiful eye.&apos;Last now, but perhaps first for posterity, are the books that Shadia Alem illustrates. Djnniyat Lar is a series of 21 paintings in which the artists wrestles freedom of imagination without leaving the boundaries of anthropomorphism. At the request of Al-Mansouria her sister Raja wrote stories to go with the images of the djinn. For this she must have had assistance from a passing army of these creatures. Raja told us at <Organization>Edge of Arabia</Organization> that for a month she was without inspiration to write stories and then wrote down 40 of them in half an hour. Although she informed us in the same interview that she tells lies all the time, this may actually be true since such events happen in opposition to what must have passed at the city of <Location>Wabar</Location>.

"Shafic Abboud
,http://www.claude-lemand.com/artiste/shafic-abboud-2?souspage=bio</Address>
Born in <Date>1926</Date> in <Location>Lebanon</Location>, Shafic Abboud is one of the foremost Arab artists of the 20th century. His paintings are a manifesto for freedom, colour, light and joy, as well as being a permanent bridge between the art scenes of <Location>France</Location> and <Location>Lebanon</Location> and that of <Location>Europe</Location> and the <Location>Middle East</Location>. Both <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> and Parisian, he was very attached to <Location>Lebanon</Location>, to its landscapes, its light and his own childhood memories. He was from a <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> Arab Modern culture. The stories of his grandmother, who was the village’s story-<Location>teller</Location>, left an indelible mark on him, at a very early age. He was familiar with the paintings of the travelling story-tellers. The artist’s eye was also strongly influenced by Byzantine icons and traditions from his church. The writings, debates, ideals, hopes and battles characterising the Arab Nahda, a modernist and anti-clerical Renaissance which was initially driven by Arab and <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> writers, were to later have a significant impact on Abboud’s intellectual education.
Shafic Abboud arrived in <Date>1947</Date> in <Location>Paris</Location>. He blended in perfectly with the city’s artistic life, just as many other artists who had come from all over the world after the Second World War (from North and <Location>South America</Location>, <Location>Europe</Location>, <Location>Asia</Location> and <Location>North Africa</Location>). This was the second major movement of migration to <Location>Paris</Location>. <Location>France</Location>’s capital was still at the time the <Location>City</Location> of lights and the favourite destination of upcoming artists seeking for modernity, embodied by Claude Monet’s last painting period and by all the Parisian masters of the 20th century. He had a particular preference for works by Pierre Bonnard, Roger Bissière and Nicolas de Staël. Abboud’s painting gradually moved from the poetic <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> figuration towards the lyrical Parisian abstraction, followed by a move from abstraction towards a very subtle and sublime personal “abboudian transfiguration”, which was simultaneously traditional and modern, pagan and sacred.
His work is often an invitation to the joy of life, a pagan hedonism yet limited by our frail human condition. However, this does not prevent a tragic element from being present in some of his paintings. These occasionally evoke, in an obvious or subtle way, difficult situations from stages of his life or that of his friends’, the tragic events happening in <Location>Lebanon</Location>, in the Arab world and in various parts of the World. Although Abboud never overtly put forward his engagements, his oeuvre and his interviews with the Arab press reveal his opinion as well as his political and social concerns.
When I described his mature work as being ‘transfigurative’ earlier on, it seems to me that this word reflects best Abboud’s search for a synthesis between his fairy-tale like childhood world and his technical mastering of abstract Parisian painting. He sought to transcend the latter, stimulated by both Bonnard and de Staël, by giving it a soul of its own and a rich and luminous texture. Through his paintings, Abboud aimed to share his own view on both his inside and outside worlds. He transfigured images filtered from his memory into painting, such as his series of Destroyed Cafés of <Date>1990</Date>. These large colourful compositions beam the tragic reality of the war in <Location>Lebanon</Location> devastating the cafés by the sea in <Location>Beirut</Location>, which Abboud loved going to on his own or with his friends, when he used to visit every winter until <Date>1975</Date>. In a similar way, he also transfigured his memory of his friend Simone after her death, whose dresses fascinated Abboud with their various shimmering fabrics. Being neither a devout follower nor believer of any religion, Abboud was nonetheless very much influenced by the glory of the Byzantine <Origin>Greco</Origin>-Arab liturgy. Symbolically, Art triumphs over death.
Please allow me to remind you the importance of this artist. Not only the <Origin>French</Origin> but also the <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> and Arab critics acknowledged the quality of Abboud’s painting at a very early stage in his life. Furthermore, he was the first and only artist from the Arab World to participate to the first <Organization>Biennale of Paris</Organization> in <Date>1959</Date>. In <Location>Lebanon</Location>, during two decades <Date>1950-1970</Date>, he played a major role for <Location>Beirut</Location>’s cultural and artistic life. <Location>Beirut</Location> was the beam of all the Near-Eastern countries, and had experienced many fruitful hours of freedom, creativity, prosperity and a particular way of life, which contributed to its international reputation. Up to <Date>1975</Date>, Abboud was used to spending the three winter months in <Location>Lebanon</Location>. He taught at the <Organization>Lebanese University</Organization> and organised personal exhibitions in one of the best galleries of the capital. Abboud’s works were exhibited alongside the biggest names of the Parisian art scene up to 1968, and he participated to the <Organization>FIAC</Organization> in <Location>Paris</Location>, from <Date>1983</Date> onwards. In <Date>1994</Date>, after 15 years of war, the show of his oeuvre in <Location>Beirut</Location> was a huge media and commercial success. When Abboud passed away in <Date>April 2004</Date>, a moving farewell ceremony was organised at the <Location>Parc</Location> Montsouris in <Location>Paris</Location>’ 14th district, very close to where the artist had his small studio. Abboud then received a triumphant welcome, when his body was transferred to <Location>Beirut</Location> and to <Location>Mount Lebanon</Location>, where he was buried, as per his wish./n"

"Shahpour Pouyan,http://www.lawrieshabibi.com/artists/29-shahpour-pouyan/overview/</Address>
Shahpour Pouyan&apos;s work is a commentary about power, domination and possession through the force of culture.  His interest lies in singling out particular objects whose images captivate him, and by painting them he releases the feeling of anguish they create.
Pouyan&apos;s hooves are symbols for the aspiration of power, lonely beings with vain attempts at grandeur which are faintly ridiculous provoking mixed feelings of pity and contempt.  The works draw their inspiration from <Origin>Iranian</Origin> miniatures with references to the cow as the symbol of power in the ancient cultures of Sumer, Babylon, <Location>Iran</Location> and Hinduism, emphasising the superego of male aggression throughout the centuries.
Pouyan brings the same spirit to his projectiles, demonstrating his wry sense of humour through references to high Persian culture.  Working with traditional armourers and metal-smiths, and taking intricately decorated costume armour and military helmets, he has morphed them into the shape of modern rockets or &apos;projectiles&apos;.  These suspended sculptures have an unsettling human-like experience closely resembling actors in the &apos;Taziyeh&apos; (passion play) performed during the month of <Date>Muharram</Date>.
Born in <Location>Isfahan</Location>, <Location>Iran</Location>, in <Date>1979</Date>, Shahpour Pouyan currently lives and works between <Location>New York</Location> and <Location>Tehran</Location>. He recently completed an MFA in Integrated Practices and New Forms at <Organization>Pratt Institute</Organization>, <Location>New York</Location>, and has an MFA in Painting from the <Organization>Tehran University of Art</Organization>. He previously studied Neoplatonic Philosophy at the <Origin>Iranian</Origin> <Organization>Institute of Philosophy</Organization> and received a diploma in Math and Physics from <Organization>Elmieh School</Organization>, <Location>Tehran</Location>. <Date>Between 2007 and 2009</Date> he taught art history and the history of Persian Architecture at <Organization>Science</Organization> and <Organization>Culture University</Organization>, <Location>Tehran</Location>. Pouyan has had numerous solo gallery shows including <Organization>XVA Gallery</Organization>, <Location>Dubai</Location> (<Date>2009</Date>), Sixty Six <Organization>Art</Organization> <Organization>Gallery</Organization>, <Location>Tehran</Location> (<Date>2010</Date>) and <Organization>Lawrie Shabibi</Organization> (<Date>2014</Date>), and has participated in numerous group exhibitions and art fairs around the world, most recently in the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, <Location>India</Location> (<Date>2014</Date>), UNTITLED <Organization>Art</Organization> Fair, <Location>Miami Beach</Location>, <Location>Florida</Location> (<Date>2014</Date>), the Mykonos Biennale, <Location>Greece</Location> (<Date>2013</Date>) and <Organization>Art</Organization> 13 <Location>London</Location>, <Location>UK</Location> (<Date>2013</Date>).

She uses typography as her medium to explore socio-political themes heavily influenced by her Persian heritage. Her explicative use of the Farsi language and its poetry creates graphic and dynamic imagery, captivating regardless of one’s knowledge of the language or culture. In What Lies Beneath | Second Edition, the artist presents a series of black and white photographs entitled ‘Mountains of Alas and Regret’ and a video work. The mountainscapes, playing with Farsi words by creating landscapes from them, redefine expressions of emotion, literally and metaphorically shrouding them to create an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. Chavangalaee explores the sensation of the sublime, the pleasant pain that feats of nature arouse. She evokes the countless ‘mountains’ that we feel defeated by, or disappointed by if we eventually reach their summit.
Chavangalaee’s video project ‘Artist in Residence’, created during her recent residency in <Location>London</Location> with Magic of Persia, documents the artist applying eye make-up repeatedly until her eyes are smothered in black. She reveals her profound feelings of frustration and isolation as she stands alone carrying out her ritual in various notable locations across <Location>London</Location>.
Since graduating, Chavangalaee has featured in a number of group shows internationally, most recently in Persia Now: Contemporary <Origin>Iranian</Origin> Art at the New Albion Gallery, <Location>Sydney</Location> in <Date>2012</Date> and a group show at the <Organization>Jamm Art Foundation</Organization>, <Location>Kuwait</Location> in <Date>2011</Date>.

Influenced by artists from the Modernist and Bauhaus Movements - such as Paul Klee, Carle Andre and Wassily Kandinsky  - Al Mazrou uses the formal aspects of minimalism to engage with a current fascination with materiality in art. Often in her works she combines mass-produced materials - such as electronic waste or construction materials - with colour and form, experimenting with these resources to create abstract geometric arrangements. Fascinated by notions of physical space, her sculptures and installations materialise as simple gestures that emphasise the representation of tension, weight and space.
Al Mazrou&apos;s  group exhibitions include the 1° International Arezzo Biennial of <Organization>Art</Organization>, <Location>Italy</Location> (<Date>2013</Date>); <Organization>Art Dubai</Organization> (<Date>2013</Date>); 14th Asian <Organization>Art</Organization> Biennale, <Origin><Location>Bangladesh</Location></Origin> (<Date>2010</Date>); <Organization>Sharjah Art Museum</Organization>, <Location>UAE</Location> and <Organization>Museum of Modern Art</Organization>, <Location>Germany</Location> (<Date>2010</Date>). She has taken part in residency programs at the <Organization>Delfina Foundation</Organization>, <Location>London</Location> in collaboration with <Organization>Tashkeel</Organization>, <Organization>Dubai Culture and Arts Authority</Organization>, Bastakiya, <Location>Dubai</Location>.  Throughout <Date>2014/2015</Date> Al Mazrou participated in the ground breaking group exhibition Past Forward, Contemporary <Organization>Art</Organization> from the <Location>Emirates</Location>, the first exhibition of Emirati <Organization>Art</Organization> to tour across the <Location>USA</Location>. Having premiered in <Location>Washington</Location>, <Location>D.C.</Location> in <Date>May 2014</Date>, the exhibition continued to the <Organization>Fowler Museum</Organization> in UCLA, <Location>Los Angeles</Location> from <Date>25 January</Date> to <Date>8 March 2015</Date>.
In <Date>2014</Date> Al Mazrou was one of five international artists commissioned by the <Organization>Arab Fund</Organization> for <Organization>Art &amp; Culture</Organization> to produce a public artwork in <Location>Dubai</Location> as part of their event &apos;Make <Organization>Art</Organization> Possible&apos;.

Shalima Sharbatli. So we read on the internet: in <Location>Jeddah</Location> the apples from <Location>France</Location> and the oranges from <Location>Egypt</Location> come in Sharbatli boxes and have Sharbatli stickers on them. It is no surprise then that Shalima Sharbatli informs people that she lives with art 24 hours a day. &apos;An instinctive <Origin>Saudi</Origin> painter,&apos; she herself was branded by Arab News and having to juggle at a young age with a touch of paradise perhaps educated her with knowledge that needs discovery. No images of her artwork travel on the internet, but for the picture in Arab News of herself as an artist, revealing a pair of trousers usually reserved for the atelier, and in front of one of her large outside works in <Location>Jeddah</Location>. The latest news on her is that she is planning a joint exibition in <Location>Paris</Location> with two artists from <Location>France</Location> and <Location>Spain</Location>. Mitterand Jr. will open the show. It is indeed about finding - not building - bridges, but art is not an international language, as Shalima is quoted to have said in wonder of people who &apos;imprison&apos; themselves in local subjects. Art needs a viewpoint. The very best artists have eyes at the back of their heads, instinctively. As she is reported to have said that the music made her proud, a closer look at Sharbatli&apos;s work will surely reveal some lines of the national anthem of <Location>Saudi Arabia</Location>. Perhaps the daring scale of her work is such a line and those visiting the government guesthouse in <Location>Jeddah</Location>, should look out for a 17 meter long wall painting and be the judge of it. The limited glimpse of her work in the Arab News photo reminds me of a <Origin>Dutch</Origin> woman of noble birth, Jacoba van Heemskerk, who&apos;s more abstract paintings were influenced by Cubism and <Origin>German</Origin> expressionism, and who started very much by painting with the brain and struggled to jump out. But that is not Shabatli. It looks like the paint jumped on her first.

"Sliman Mansour,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Sliman-Mansour.aspx</Address>
Sliman Mansour is one of the most distinguished Palestinian artists working <Date>today</Date>. Throughout his forty-year career, Mansour has established himself as an internationally recognized artist dedicated to giving visual expression to Palestinian identity.
Born in <Date>1947</Date> in Birzeit, a Palestinian town north of Ramallah, Mansour studied fine arts at <Organization>Bezalel Art Academy</Organization> in <Location>Jerusalem</Location>. Since the seventies, he has contributed to the development of an iconography of the Palestinian struggle through his works on paper. Uniting Mansour&apos;s body of work is the depiction of the orange tree (considered to symbolize the 1948 Nakba), the olive tree (considered to symbolize the 1967 war), traditional Palestinian embroidery, village life, and the figure of the Palestinian woman as the mother figure figure of <Location>Palestine</Location>, giving birth to and protecting the Palestinian people. One of Mansour&apos;s most recognized works is the <Date>1974</Date> painting, Camel of Hardship. In this image, the figure of the porter bends under the weight of his satchel, which is significantly shaped like an eye and holds the city of <Location>Jerusalem</Location> as identified by the <Organization>Dome</Organization> of the <Location>Rock</Location>. Personifying <Location>Palestine</Location> through the figure of an old, weary, and isolated man, Mansour captures the concept of sumud, or steadfastness, and the continuing endurance of the struggle despite hardship. Before its international acclaim, the piece resonated locally as it was printed as posters in <Date>1975</Date> and displayed in homes and public venues throughout the <Organization>West Bank</Organization> and <Location>Gaza</Location>.
In <Date>1987</Date>, together with artists Vera Tamari, Tayseer Barakat, and Nabil Anani, Mansour founded New Visions, a collective formed in response to the first intifada (<Date>1987 - 1993</Date>). While fostering a revolutionary approach to aesthetics in Palestinian art, the artists also participated in the intifada by boycotting art supplies imported from <Location>Israel</Location>. Working instead with natural materials such as coffee, henna, and clay, the artists tied the process of art making to both the land and the struggle. This body of work documents an important moment in the history of Palestinian art. Although the artists adopted a nationalist agenda similar to other artists working in the social realist style, the distinction lies in an abstracted composition. <Organization>Art</Organization> no longer merely represented the political, but instead artistic production itself constituted a political act.
Since then, Mansour has become acclaimed for a unique body of work that uses mud as a medium. Layering and molding mud into figural compositions on a wooden framework, Mansour deploys the actual land to depict <Location>Palestine</Location>, its history, and people. Working in a variety of sizes—some pieces are life-size—the artist creates what critics have termed &quot;emblems of decay,&quot; as the cracks and distortions of the drying process suggest the passage of time and the impermanence of materiality. In one of his most important series from <Date>1996</Date> entitled, I am Ismail, the artist molds a relief of the biblical figure into what appears as an ancient tombstone. Commemorating Ismail&apos;s story of exile and his relation to the land, Mansour suggests through the title his own autobiographical connection to the story of Ismail. The series documents the artist&apos;s continued dedication to a set of aesthetic concerns intimately related to the visualization of the Palestinian struggle in all its hardships and aspirations.
Mansour has contributed extensively to the development of an infrastructure for the fine arts in the <Organization>West Bank</Organization>. He was the head of the League of Palestinian Artists <Date>from 1986 to 1990</Date>. In <Date>1994</Date>, Mansour co-founded al-Wasiti <Organization>Art Center</Organization> in <Location>East Jerusalem</Location> and served as Director <Date>from 1995 to 1996</Date>. He is a member of the <Organization>Founding Board of Directors</Organization> of the <Organization>International Academy of Art Palestine</Organization>, established in <Date>2004</Date> in Ramallah. He has taught at numerous cultural institutions and universities throughout the <Organization>West Bank</Organization>, including <Organization>Al-Quds University</Organization>. Also a professional cartoonist, Mansour published <Date>from 1981 to 1993</Date> in Al-Fajr <Origin>English</Origin> Weekly, a Palestinian <Origin>English</Origin> weekly formerly published in <Location>Jerusalem</Location>. He is the co-author of the <Date>1998</Date> publication, Both Sides of Peace: <Origin>Israeli</Origin> and Palestinian Political Poster <Organization>Art</Organization>."

"Suad Al Attar,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Suad-al-Attar.aspx</Address>
Suad al-Attar&apos;s is part of a generation of artists who benefited from the educational foundation laid by art educators like Hafidh al-Droubi and Faiq Hassan. As one of <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s leading female artists, however, she is also a pioneer in her own right. Al-Attar earned degrees from the <Organization>Academy of Fine Art</Organization> in <Location>Baghdad</Location> and <Organization>California State University</Organization>. She also did graduate work in <Location>London</Location>, studying printmaking at the <Organization>Wimbledon School of Art</Organization> and the <Organization>Central School of Art</Organization> and Design. Following her studies, Al-Attar taught at the <Organization>University of Baghdad</Organization>. In 1965, the artist held a solo exhibition in <Location>Baghdad</Location>, becoming the first woman to do so. Her surreal canvases have a uniquely mysterious quality that resonate with <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s rich literary past. Al-Attar is counted among the many modern and contemporary <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> artists who are committed to preserving the cultural traditions of their homeland.
Suad al-Attar became actively engaged in the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> art scene in <Date>the 1960s</Date>. However, her artistic output reached maturity in <Date>the 1970s</Date>. During this time <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> art gained unprecedented international exposure. The government frequently sponsored artists to travel for international art events and foreign artists were invited to participate in domestic art festivals and exhibitions.  Al-Attar played a major role in this outward movement exhibiting extensively in international biennials, where she won a number of awards (specifically at biennials in <Location>London</Location> in <Date>1978</Date>, <Location>Cairo</Location> in <Date>1984</Date>, <Location>Brazil</Location> in <Date>1985</Date>, and <Location>Malta</Location> in <Date>1995</Date>). Al-Attar also participated in the London-based Third World Biennale of Graphic <Organization>Art</Organization> in <Date>1980</Date> which brought together printmakers from various nations in collective exploration of the media.
Although al-Attar has lived in <Location>London</Location> since <Date>1976</Date>, she has remained faithful to the cultural heritage of her birthplace. She has embraced <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s folkloric past drawing inspiration from Arab poetry, history, and mythology. Winged and composite creatures make a regular appearance as subject matter for the artist, recalling Assyrian and Sumerian visual culture. Other common motifs like palm trees, horses, and peacocks are also indicative of Mesopotamian, as well as medieval Islamic, influence. These subjects have since become powerful symbols for <Location>Iraq</Location> itself. In addition, classical and contemp​orary poetry​ of the region has been a constant source of inspiration for the artist. The ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh for example provided a literary backdrop for al-Attar&apos;s visual interpretations of the story&apos;s setting and characters. The artist also draws textual parallels in more obvious ways by weaving calligraphic poetry in and around her landscapes and figures.
Her vision of <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s past and present is imbued with fantastical properties. Al-Attar&apos;s oeuvre is composed of a kaleidoscope of surreal landscapes, mythical creatures, and epic characters. Even the artist&apos;s portraits are infused with a dreamlike quality. The phantasmagoric nature of al-Attar&apos;s canvases con​jure imaginative tales of days past and transports the viewer to an otherworldly space. Oftentimes utilizing a monochromatic color scheme, her characters emerge from fantastic landscapes or fading architecture. They gaze out at the viewer, inviting them to participate in an emotive and epic narrative as if the audience is the ultimate interpreter of the enigmatic scene.
Encouraged by her graphic sensitivity, much of her work is flat, linear, and emblematic. Pattern and ornamentation play a central role in her compositions. It has been suggested that al-Attar developed her style based on Islamic miniatures. Although her canvases can be quite large, this influence can be clearly seen in al-Attar&apos;s treatment of plant life, her attention to minute detail, and in her use of decorative patterning. Furthermore, there seems to be an effort towards beautification and novelty of design that is ever-present in both instances.
Al-Attar&apos;s visual interpretations of poetry and folklore are deeply personal and provocative in a way that is distinct and still resonates with viewers. Although al-Attar&apos;s oeuvre can and should be viewed within the tradition modern <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> inaugurated by the work of such figures as Faiq Hassan and Jewad Selim, her art also contains introspective qualities that hint at an underlying femininity. She has developed a personalized set of symbols that disclose an intimate engagement with her subjects through self-exploration and remembrance. Derived from her childhood memories these symbols include gold for the domes of the city, a fish for the Tigris, and a rooster for life in <Location>Baghdad</Location>; all reminders of home. Indeed, Al-Attar&apos;s blending of dreamscape and reality is transformative leading the viewer to a metaphysical understanding of <Location>Iraq</Location>&apos;s rich cultural heritage. Ultimately, however, this understanding is mediated through the artist​&apos;s private emotive lens.
Al-Attar&apos;s more recent works continue this emotively imaginative quality, yet at the same time also engage more directly with current national realities, exploring and expressing the trauma that <Location>Iraq</Location> has suffered since <Date>the 1990s</Date>.
Al-Attar&apos;s work is held in both private and public collections, including many prestigious art institutions like the <Organization>British Museum</Organization> and the <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>, <Location>Qatar</Location>. Unfortunately, her work is also featured on the <Origin>Iraqi</Origin> <Organization>National Museum</Organization> of Modern <Organization>Art</Organization>&apos;s Red List, meaning her work was looted from the museum in the wake of the US-led invasion."

She knows how to handle paint and learned to do so in painting classes given in Damman, Qatif and <Location>Syria</Location>. As a painter she has steadily been building a body of work, that shows she got to know the classics of modern art, which fit very well <Origin>Saudi</Origin> concepts that there is not much gain in trying to depict nature-true with paint. It is the modern abstaction which accepts gracefully our own failure at creation and makes the best of it. So at least could be a vision of art. A very frank Al-Bagshi shares with us however her first efforts of <Date>2001</Date> in her on-line gallery, which indicate she moved from a romantic sea shore vision to the inner thoughts of humans, often ruled by the moon; in form not unlike those caught in stone by Modigliani. It is in <Date>2007</Date> that suddenly again the sun appears and her paintings flow with colour. Then too, all figurative efforts sometimes dissolve as they did in two painted boards.

Talal Al-Zeid (<Date>1981</Date>) has a website which repeats three times an opening statement: that we should never judge a painting by its colour. Yes, that we should never judge a painting by its colour. And readers who agree with Talal should never judge a painting by its colour. As long as they remember that when the sky is blue it might not rain.
Talal is one of those much travelled <Origin>Saudi</Origin>&apos;s who has set up camp again in <Location>Riyadh</Location> and it seems that he has rediscovered the austere black-and-white fashion of local wisdom among the many flags of the world. Those flags perhaps, one may agree, advertise no more than biscuits. They are all biscuits (<Date>2009</Date>) it reads in mirror image in his paint on paper work of similar title. It is only the idea that tastes well in this work of art, so it is in essence no different from the world&apos;s oldest calligraphy. And actually it is a very funny idea. Imagine a gathering of officially dressed <Origin>Saudi</Origin> males and then allow on stage Talal&apos;s simple thought about biscuits.
&apos;Being unoriginal is <Date>today</Date>&apos;s &quot;Pandemic,&quot; is another statement the artist allows pride of place on his website. So is the artist himself original? Graffitti and armed comics are the shoulders on which Talal&apos;s art stands, but his stance is not just a love affair with this underground smell. His stones are thrown with measured intelligence and with a genuine interest in the many faces of humanity. One day we may wake up finding the artist has become an official in the foreign office and has forgiven even the spoilt brats who appear to irritate him. One wonders if he writes Arabic too.Talal exhibited his work at <Organization>Oasis Magazine</Organization>&apos;s first &quot;O&quot; exhibition in <Date>2010</Date>. (<Date>2010</Date>).

Tanbak initially sought to become an author.

She thus embarked on an artistic career as an autodidact, painting and creating installations using every object she could find that inspired her. Tanbak’s choice of materials thus corresponds to her desire to encompass all aspects of her daily life. She exploits the expressive possibilities of paint, watercolour, paper, glue, but also of more unusual materials such as trash or old buttons. Her art combines a variety of medias and textures to inspire a reflection on the eternal cycle of life and death, to provoke a meditation on the real meaning of art and show how a human body can move and relate to others.&#160;

He has taught at the <Organization><Origin>American</Origin> University of Sharjah</Organization> and is currently a professor at <Organization>New York University</Organization> in <Location>Abu Dhabi</Location>. His first exhibition with Taymour Grahne Gallery opened in <Date>September 2014</Date>. His work, photographs often featuring the figure of the artist silhouetted against barren urban and desert landscapes of the region, serves as a partial allegory for the obstacles and forms of control facing Palestinians both within and exiled from the Palestinian territories, as well as troubling Western representations of Arabs as terrorists. Other series use the desert as a stage for investigating the artist’s relationship to land and place, in the midst of the rapid urban transformation witnessed in the <Location>UAE</Location>, where the artist lives.

These objective issues which are part and parcel of the social, political and cultural context in <Location>Palestine</Location> also reflect the position of the artist as a witness and contributor to the life of his country, but also the Western art scene.
Born in <Location>Gaza</Location> in <Date>1966</Date>, Taysir Batniji studied art at <Organization>Al-Najah University</Organization> in <Location>Nablus</Location>, then continued in <Location>France</Location> at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts de Bourges, Université <Location>Paris</Location> 8, <Location>Saint-Denis</Location>, and the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts de <Location>Marseille</Location>.

Deeply marked by the <Origin>Israeli</Origin>-Palestinian conflict and the future of the <Location>Middle East</Location>, the artist develops a work which reveals the social, political and economical context of life in <Location>Palestine</Location>.
Graduate from the school of Art and Cinema in <Location>Tunis</Location>, he first directed films before shifting to a visual production in <Date>2006</Date>. According to him, this is a more suited format to express the Palestinian question. Using photography and sculpture, he has been creating environments revealing a reality in which past and future are intrinsically linked.
Integral part of the Photolife project, the Qalandia series (<Date>2006-2009</Date>) particularly expresses the involvement of the artist through the vision of a Palestinian reality projected a hundred years after the great events of its history: the Palestinian exodus (Qalandia 2047), the six-day war (Qalandia 2067) and the first Intifada (Qalandia 2087). Emblematic of the artist production, the works which reconstitutes one of the main check-points and Palestinian refugee camps as an architectural model were (separately) exhibited at the 1st <Location>Thessaloniki</Location> biennial in <Date>2007</Date>, and in <Date>2009</Date> at &quot;Unveiled: New Art from the <Location>Middle East</Location>&quot; at the Saatchi Gallery in <Location>London</Location>, the 11th <Location>Istanbul</Location> biennial and at &quot;Disorientation II&quot; in <Location>Abu Dhabi</Location>.

"Walid Raad,http://nadour.org/artists/walid-raad/</Address>
Born in <Date>1967</Date> in Chbanieh in the <Location>Lebanon</Location>, Walid Raad is an artist whose work reflects the troubled history of his country of origin, which he has witnessed since childhood. By collecting, modifying and creating photographs, texts and videos, he plays on the idea of the document as it relates to the civil war and the troubles between communities which have shaken this territory. The artist infuses his depictions with a cloudiness intended to throw doubt on the notion of documentation itself, and posing a profound question about how History is constructed. His working method involves artistic processes such as montage, hijacking and displacement which he uses to create his poetic, semantic distortions against the backgrounds he manipulates.
Since <Date>1999</Date>, this work on archives and memory through images has evolved around the <Organization>Atlas Group</Organization>, a fictitious organisation which produces, conserves and studies documents about the contemporary history of <Location>Lebanon</Location>, initiated and activated by Walid Raad. The artist is also a member of the <Organization>AIF</Organization> (<Organization>Arab Image Foundation</Organization>), an institution based in <Location>Beirut</Location> since <Date>1997</Date>, responsible for collecting and promoting a visual heritage of the <Location>Middle East</Location>, <Location>North Africa</Location> and the <Organization>Arab</Organization> Diaspora.
Walid Raad lives and works in <Location>Beirut</Location> (<Location>Lebanon</Location>) and <Location>New York</Location> (<Location>USA</Location>).

The early work of artist and writer Walid Sadek investigated the violent legacies of the <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> civil war (<Date>1975-1990</Date>) as partially and inadequately seen and experienced by a young Christian-born <Origin>Lebanese</Origin>. He later began to posit, mostly in theoretical texts, ways of understanding the complexity of lingering civil strife in times of relative social and economical stability. His recent written work, in art and in writing, endeavours to structure a theory for approaching the ambivalence of living through a protracted civil-war.

"Yazid Oulab,http://nadour.org/artists/yazid-oulab/</Address>
Informed by the issues surrounding <Location>Western Art</Location>, drawing from a literary and poetic tradition, the work of Yazid Oulab is a quest for meaning. In his sculptures, videos, installations and also his drawings, the artist declines an iconography linked to his own experience: everyday objects (jars, scales, crates, carpets) , sometimes with a sacred association (incense sticks, sacrificial knives), or to the building trade which he practised in order to finance his studies (trowel, carpenter’s pencil, scaffolding).
Simple, pared down, the forms he creates can never be reduced to mere signs however, since their physicality and the gestures they elicit hold a power and nobility of their own. The artist’s work bridges the gap between feeling and symbolism, symbol and text, craft and ritual, it accompanies a move towards spiritual knowledge, going beyond surface appearance.
Born in <Date>1958</Date> in the Constantine region of <Location>Algeria</Location>, Yazid Oulab has lived and worked in Marseilles since <Date>1988</Date>. Graduating from the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Algiers</Location> in <Date>1985</Date>, then the <Organization>National School of Fine Arts</Organization> in Marseilles in <Date>1992</Date>, he has exhibited since the beginning of the ‘eighties on both sides of the <Location>Mediterranean</Location>, but also in <Location>Ankara</Location>, in <Location>Dubai</Location> and in <Location>New York</Location>. He has taken part in numerous exhibitions at major institutions such as the <Organization>Centre Georges Pompidou(Paris)</Organization> The Grand Palais (<Location>Paris</Location>), the Musée des Abattoirs (<Location>Toulouse</Location>), the MUDAM (<Origin><Location>Luxembourg</Location></Origin>) and the MNAC (<Location>Bucharest</Location>). He was also invited in <Date>2009</Date> to be artist in residence at the atelier Calder in Saché, in the Touraine.

"Younès Rahmoun,http://nadour.org/artists/younes-rahmoun/</Address>
Younès Rahmoun was born in <Date>1975</Date> in <Location>Tetouan</Location>, in <Location>Morocco</Location>, where he currently lives and works. He studied at the <Organization>National Fine Arts Institute</Organization> of the city and set up his workshop, in <Date>1998</Date>, in a small room of the family house which later inspired his series of installations Ghorfa.
In an obvious simplicity of materials and forms and whatever the formats (video, installation, performance), Younès Rahmoun evokes a personal universe, intrinsically connected to Sufi thought and practice. He makes them accessible, willing to trigger an exchange, a meeting and a dialogue. A certain number of codes and practices can be found in his work – including repetition, incantation, insistence, concentration, the orientation of his installations towards <Location>Mecca</Location>, the use of sacred numbers, or the use of green light - which invite the visitor to experience immateriality.
As opposed to cultural and identity remoteness, the concern of Younès Rahmoun manifests itself as the expression of a presence in the world. Between the use of new technologies and the appropriation of techniques resulting from the most local craft, the artist syntheses a context in order to highlight what is related to a specific space/time. Presented on the international scene through several major exhibitions and biennials, such as the Canaries, Pontevedra, <Location>Dakar</Location> or <Location>Singapore</Location> Biennials, his work spreads a universal message of intimate and interpersonal communion.

"Youssef Kamel,http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org/en/bios/Pages/Youssef-Kamel.aspx</Address>
Youssef Kamel was born in the neighborhood of El-Dahir in <Location>Cairo</Location>. In 1908, he was among the first students to join the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> together with artists Mahmoud Mokhtar (<Date>1891 - 1934</Date>), Ragheb Ayad (<Date>1892 - 1982</Date>), Antoine Haggar (<Date>1896 - 1962</Date>) and Mohammed Hassan (<Date>1892 - 1961</Date>). The School was founded the same year by Prince Youssef Kamal. Kamel studied in the painting section under the <Origin>Italian</Origin> painter Paolo Forcella. He graduated in <Date>1911</Date> and the same year, and participated in the first exhibition of the students of the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> held at the <Organization>Automobile Club</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>. In 1912, he was appointed as a drawing teacher in secondary schools. <Date>Between 1921 and 1922</Date>, Kamel and his friend, the painter Ragheb Ayad agreed on an exchange, according to which each of them would work in turns as a teacher for one year to finance the other&apos;s stay in <Location>Italy</Location>.
In 1925, Kamel received a scholarship to pursue his studies at the <Organization>Royal Academy</Organization> of Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> in <Location>Rome</Location> together with his colleagues, Ragheb Ayad and Mohammed Hassan. He shared a studio with them in <Location>Rome</Location> and studied under the renowned <Origin>Italian</Origin> painter Umberto Coromaldi (<Date>1870 - 1948</Date>). During that period, he executed several copies of masterpieces in the collection of the Villa Borghese and painted a series of vedute, <Origin>Italian</Origin> townscape views, featuring Roman antique and Renaissance monuments, a genre he would later transpose to medieval <Location>Cairo</Location>. After receiving his diploma from the <Organization>Royal Academy</Organization> of Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> in <Location>Rome</Location>, Kamel returned to his homeland in <Date>1929</Date> and was appointed professor of painting at the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>. In 1937, he became the head of the painting section when the Alexandrian painter and diplomat, Mohammed Naghi (<Date>1888 - 1956</Date>), was director of this institution. Kamel also worked as a curator and directed the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> Art <Date>from 1948 to 1949</Date> before he was named director of the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location> <Date>between 1950 and 1953</Date>.
Youssef Kamel belongs to a generation of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> artists commonly referred to as the pioneers (al-ruwwād), as they were the first to be educated in artistic institutions established according to European models, such as the <Organization>School of Fine Arts</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>. Kamel remained faithful to the lessons of his two <Origin>Italian</Origin> teachers, Paolo Forcella and Umberto Coromaldi, who were both followers of the Machiaioli movement. They introduced him to the technique of oil painting and the genres of landscape, nudes and portraits, which Kamel adapted to <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> subjects. His work expresses a sense of peacefulness and nostalgic timelessness through the use of light strokes and gentle colors. Kamel also portrayed some of his contemporaries and friends with great sincerity, such as the sculptor Mahmoud Mokhtar as well as individuals from the countryside and the working-class neighborhoods of <Location>Cairo</Location>. His works can be found in private collections, the <Organization>Museum of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> Modern</Organization> Art in <Location>Cairo</Location>, the <Organization>Agricultural Museum</Organization> in <Location>Cairo</Location>, as well as in the Mathaf: <Organization>Arab Museum of Modern Art</Organization> in <Location>Doha</Location>. Unfortunately, on the <Date>20th of July 2012</Date>, an important collection of his works was stolen, following a looting in his family villa in the neighborhood of Matariya in <Location>northern Cairo</Location> where many of his paintings were preserved.

"Youssef Nabil,http://nadour.org/artists/youssef-nabil-bio/</Address>
Brought up on the great era of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> cinema Youssef Nabil retains a feeling of nostalgia for the glamorous aestheticism of the ‘40s and ‘50s. Born in <Location>Egypt</Location> in <Date>1972</Date>, he grew up in the streets of <Location>Cairo</Location> where hand-painted cinema posters gave the walls a timeless elegance, whilst classics from a past era shown on television were to inspire his first love of the big screen.
Whilst studying litterature at the <Organization>University of Cairo</Organization> in <Date>1992</Date>, as a sideline he began producing black and white photographs; highly dramatic scenes inspired by the golden age of <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> cinema. Some encounters were to have a very early influence on in his career: for instance with David Lachapelle (<Date>1993-1994</Date>) and Mario Testino (<Date>1997-1998</Date>) whom he accompanied as assistant photographer from <Location>New York</Location> to <Location>Paris</Location>.
On returning to <Location>Egypt</Location> in <Date>1999</Date>, Youssef Nabil decides to put colour into his black and white silver gelatin prints; old-fashioned images produced in the spirit of the great studios, after a dream-like vision shared with his friend Van Leo (Leon Boyadjian, <Date>1921-2002</Date>). By using a brush to retouch each one of his portraits, he magnifies the expressions of the models he has immortalised – <Origin>Egyptian</Origin> personalities and international celebrities from cinema, music, fashion, art and architecture: from Catherine Deneuve to Omar Sharif, Natacha Atlas to Jean-Paul Gaultier and people like Tracey Emin and Zaha Hadid...
Moving from one place to the next, the wanderings of Youssef Nabil recounted through his self-portraits mirror his projects, residences and exhibitions which take place all over the world. His works have been shown in many institutions on the International art scene, amongst them : the Villa Medici (<Location>Rome</Location>), the <Organization>Venice Biennale (Venice)</Organization>, the Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie (Arles), the <Organization>Kennedy Centre (Washington)</Organization>, the <Organization>BALTIC Centre</Organization> for Contemporary Art (<Location>Newcastle</Location>), the <Organization>Institut du Monde Arabe (Paris)</Organization>, <Organization>Savannah College of Art and Design (Savannah)</Organization>, Kunstmuseum (<Location>Bonn</Location>), the <Organization>Aperture Foundation (New York)</Organization> the Centre de Cultura Contemporànea de <Location>Barcelona</Location> (<Location>Barcelona</Location>), the <Organization>British Museum (London)</Organization> and the Centro de la Imagen (<Location>Mexico</Location>). His work on the portrait was rewarded by the Seydou Keita prize in <Date>2003</Date> awarded at the photography Biennale de <Location>Bamako</Location> (<Location>Mali</Location>), while two monographs already document his work: Sleep In My Arms (Autograph ABP and Michael Stevenson, <Date>2007</Date>) and I Won’t Let You Die (Hatje Cantz, <Date>2008</Date>).

Zena El Khalil uses a very personal visual language, marked by disillusion, irony and romance. Her universe illustrates the madness and contrasts of a city like <Location>Beirut</Location>, where war is always latent and where bombs punctuate people’s existence.
Her large scale painting or installation compositions bring together a whole set of war memorabilia, objects and iconographies from the seventies to the present days. There, Zena juxtaposes large pink fabrics where plastic tanks and Kalashnikovs decorated with spangles are entangled within numerous cheap artefacts. They reflect the “other” obsessions which haunt young <Origin>Lebanese</Origin> women living under threat; the search for a husband, plastic surgery, pop stars, etc. These alternative concerns are strongly recommended for their powerful sedative power.
Zena El Khalil was born in <Location>London</Location> in <Date>1976</Date>. She spent her childhood in <Location>Nigeria</Location> and returned to <Location>England</Location> as a teenager. She graduated in graphic design from the <Organization><Origin>American</Origin> University of Beirut</Organization> in <Location>Lebanon</Location> and obtained a Master in Fine <Organization>Arts</Organization> from the <Organization>School of Visual Arts</Organization> of <Location>New York</Location> in <Date>2002</Date>.

His videos undeniably testify to a world in conflict, but using a rather playful and light tone, Ziad Antar’s work immediately seduces.Focusing on a precise idea, Ziad Antar’s videos express life problems (sometimes linked to war) with a short shot and with simple means. It is with disconcerting ease and efficiency that Ziad Antar confronts the viewer with burning questions, without expressing any position and without empathy.
Music plays an important role in his work, such as in Tamborro, Wa, <Location>Tokyo</Location> Tonight or La <Location>Marche</Location> <Origin>Turque</Origin> where the eponymous partition of Mozart is being played on a cordless piano and where only the sound of the fingers striking the keys resonates, evoking the sound of a military march.

Up until <Date>2004</Date>, Zineb Sedira’s work had been concerned with issues of language and storytelling using photography and video. The work was about the artist’s family experience of immigrating to <Location>France</Location> from <Location>Algeria</Location>, her growing up in <Location>Paris</Location> and her move to <Location>England</Location> in <Date>1986</Date>. In <Date>2003-2004</Date>, Sedira’s art practice took a new direction as a result of her return to <Location>Algeria</Location> after a 15-year absence because of the civil war. A new body of work was shot in <Location>Algeria</Location> about the landscape of <Location>Algiers</Location>.

"mounir fatmi,http://nadour.org/artists/mounir-fatmi/</Address>
mounir fatmi’s installations, sculptures, videos, photographs, paintings and drawings audaciously tease and confront proprieties. He questions, plays and provokes with caustic insolence, taking on notions of power, and all kinds of extremism; the religious, the political, as well as their means; architecture and media.He selects rather basic materials, often on the verge of extinction (as with the <Organization>VHS</Organization> cassettes and the coaxial cable), yet as seen with the saw blades or wooden horse jumps, they always elicit relevant connotations. Although aesthetically very seductive, mounir fatmi’s work offers a look at the world from another angle, refusing to be blinded by conventions.
mounir fatmi was born in <Location>Tangiers</Location>, <Location>Morocco</Location> in <Date>1970</Date>. He graduated in Fine Arts in <Location>Casablanca</Location> in <Date>1989</Date> and in <Location>Rome</Location> in <Date>1991</Date>.

He has also participated in several biennales amongst which; the <Organization>Gwangju Biennale</Organization>, <Location>Korea</Location>, the 2nd <Location>Sevilla</Location> <Organization>Biennale</Organization>, <Location>Spain</Location>, the 8th <Location>Sharjah</Location> <Organization>Biennale</Organization>, <Location>United Arab Emirates</Location>, the 52nd <Organization>Venice Biennale</Organization>, <Location>Italy</Location>, the 10th <Location>Lyon</Location> <Organization>Biennale</Organization>, <Location>France</Location>, the Cuvée <Organization>Biennale</Organization>, <Location>Linz</Location>, <Location>Austria</Location>.
