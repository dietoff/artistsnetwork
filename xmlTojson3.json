Their studio has functioned as a space for dialogue and they enrich their process by engaging other artists and professionals in fields ranging from chemistry to industrial engineering.\nThe collaborative resist the limitations posed by a singular vocabulary or style and craft material and digital technologies into works that seem to belong to anticipated aesthetics. Their works range from immersive time based works and installations to sculptures and objects that thwart categorization. Publications often accompany projects to reflect their interactive process, and include a form of documentation seeking to explore concepts and contexts pertaining to emotions, behaviour, viewpoints and senses.\nTheir work also engages the public in live and embodied installations. Terribly Jolly (Istanbul, 2013) for example is a pop-up dance club contained within a small red curtained room that begins at nine am and lasts just thirty minutes, folding together the time of work and leisure to cut short any possibility of shared pleasure. By contrast FRESHCUT (Museum of Applied Arts\n, Vienna, 2013) invites the audience to cut and arrange a massive installation of flowers, transforming them into actors in an augmented cinematic reality.\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Abdul Qadir al-Rassam (1882 - 1952) was part of the first generation of modern Iraqi painters. He stands at the core of a group of artists trained in Istanbul who brought their artistic knowledge back to their home country. This group of soldier-artists is credited with introducing easel painting to Iraq at the turn of the century. Working in a realist style, al-Rassam is known for his sweeping landscapes, immaculate portraits, and faithful portrayals of everyday life in Iraq. He is one of the most prominent and prolific painters in Iraq's modern art history and his work heavily influenced the generations that followed.\nAl-Rassam was among a group of Iraqi officers to study military science and art in Istanbul. He began his education around 1904 when the Ottoman Empire was still the main power in the region. As part of his education in Istanbul, al-Rassam and his classmates were required to produce paintings or drawings for military use. These images adhered to a strict European academic style. Eager to cultivate their new skill, these officers sought out private art training. Al-Rassam himself studied under a number of prominent painters living in Istanbul who worked in contemporary French styles. Although he is most recognizable as an oil painter, al-Rassam experimented at this time with watercolors representing Istanbul with its crowds and markets. Even at this early stage in his career, the painter showed expert skill and a conscientious eye. Al-Rassam's ambitions were interrupted by the outbreak of WWI. Directly following the war, when the group of soldier-artists returned to Iraq, al-Rassam again took up easel painting. Along with his colleagues, he focused on landscapes, military scenes, and archaeological sites. \nAn important characteristic of this initial generation was their desire to stimulate awareness and appreciation of the arts amongst the Iraqi population. Al-Rassam taught painting lessons out of his studio in Baghdad and encouraged young artists to continue their art training abroad. Due to this early artistic proselytizing, al-Rassam became hugely influential to the following generations of artists. The painter's interest in promoting art awareness was further realized when he became an honorary member of the Society of the Friends\n of Art, a group that sought to cultivate public interest in art making and to enhance their own skill through interaction.    \nUtilizing the same academic style as his early colleagues, al-Rassam painted with a crisp realism capturing vistas of the Iraqi countr​yside. The clarity found in oil paints is employed to its fullest advantage by the artist, who is known for his mastery of perspective and detail. He oftentimes painted panoramic views of historical sites along the Tigris River. The ruins of Ctesiphon or the Great Mosque of Samarra were particularly notable representations in al-Rassam's oeuvre. Indeed the Tigris River was itself the central theme of many of al-Rassam's canvases. Winding as it recedes through an expert use of atmospheric perspective, the river and the activities surrounding it compose a vast, yet serene, landscape.\nAl-Rassam was also to a lesser extent a portraitist. One of his well-known portraits is of Mohamed Darouich al-Allousi, completed in 1924. The bearded sitter gazes out at the viewer with a directed stare. He is set against a background of clouds that are ever-present in most of al-Rassam's canvases. The subtleties of the face show the painter's mastery of modeling and the poignant gaze reflect his skill as a keen observer. The portrait exhibits the same attention to clarity and detail as al-Rassam's landscapes.\nA collection of al-Rassam's works was held at the Pioneers Museum\n in Baghdad and the Iraqi Museum of Modern Art\n until the destruction and the looting of the collection of the museum in 2003. He also created a mural for the entrance of a movie theater in Baghdad, The Royal Cinema. This was the first large-scale work of art to be displayed on a public building. Later in his life, the artist travelled to Italy, France, Germany, and England to expand his knowledge of art.\n   "

The artist from the town of Khamis Mushait is a luitenant-colonel of artillery (now in administration), who aims at the brains and not the bone structure of life's realities. Do not put your trust in concrete, when planning battles of the future, is what Gharem says by selecting his own ground to fire from with weapons of his choice. The training shows. The 'art people' call it performance art. People of performance might call it art of survival.\nGharem entered the field at the Sharjah 2007 biennial documenting a 'survival' performance Flora and Fauna (2006) in which he wrapped himself in plastic with a tree on a busy road in the town of Abha. He stayed in his greenhouse for several hours living of the oxygen that the tree was meant to produce. The foreign imported Conocarpus Erectus tree is much used in city landscaping in the Middle East and elsewhere, but is said to have a disastrous effect on the local tree population. Dealing directly with ecological concerns of urban planning the performance in a much broader sense may have reflected on the dangers of thoughtless adoption of foreign ideas.\n'People at first thought he was crazy,' is what Gharem told Henry Hemming in an interview for the Edge of Arabia\n (2008) exhibition. But then they started to appreciate his operations on the roads of Saudi Arabia. 'Their minds are not closed so they came over to ask about it.' Reforming people's ideas about art away from copying Italians may be collateral damage his work inflicts.\nAnother maneuvre of speed and impact was in support not of flora but of Homo Erectus himself. In Manzoa (2007) Gharem moved himself around for a day and night in a so called 'unorganized residential district' from which both the residents and houses were to be removed for new development. The name of the performance is Arabic for 'removal.' It was written on the houses to announce their fate and that of their residents and the artist had it written on his shirt during the performance.\nFrom chance of seeing a broken bridge and learning its history Gharem welded his conceptually most voluptuous work. Al-Siraat was made in the night of August 19, 2007 when the artist and his assistents covered the whole bridge with one word: al-siraat (the path). The bridge, which is in a ravine in the Tihama region, had been abandoned since it collapsed in 1982. Its tragic history is that it was used by people, trusting the concrete, as a refuge to shelter from an expected flash flood. From the idea that even concrete roads and bridges can't be trusted Gharem crossed over to associate the bridge with 'the path' in the spiritual sense of the word. 'It is about the choices you make in life, and whether or not you follow the straight path,' is what he said about it. The work was documented by photography and in a video with a touch of irony.\nAl-Siraat became part of a controversy in the British press when it was reported that the work had not been included in the Edge of Arabia\n exhibition by a decision unclearly defined as having been taken by either a sponsor, guest curators or The School of Oriental and African Studies\n .\nIn both a visual and conceptual parallel to Al Siraat Gharem produced an alternative work of art for the exhibition intended to convey a similar message. For his Restored Behavior (2008) series the artist went on a humoristic adventure of subverting bureaucracy by buying in shops all over Saudi Arabia as many office stamps as he could find. Taking out the rubber letters and numbers, glueing them on boards and then painting over them a yellow road line he created anew an image of 'the path.' Not having yourself stamped but painting your own way over stamps is not unlike 'not trusting concrete.' In the paintings the bridge crossing the ravine was changed by Gharem into a Pedestrian Crossing. And like the bridge the crossing collapsed: the two stripes of the Zebra contained an image of the Twin Towers at the moment of impact of the second airplane. As a final salvo of his serious intentions Gharem produced an oversized and useable stamp which read in both hope and irony and in both Arabic and English: 'Have a bit of commitment, Amin.' With it were three road lights to guide you in the dark. Using science in darkness may be the concept.\nHis motto: 'I will'\n   "

Abdulnasser Gharem is surely the only artist to be both a leading figure on his country’s emerging art scene and a major in the Saudi army.\nHis story began in 2003 when Abdulnasser Gharem, an army recruit, enrolled in the Al-Miftaha Arts Village in Abha, Saudi Arabia. Founded a few years earlier by Ahmed Mater, this institution soon became the nerve centre of the new art scene that was represented in the 2004 exhibition Shattah, which captured the renewal of the Saudi Arabian scene.\nFrom now on, Gharem began using the street as his studio, working in response to his local context. In numerous performances and site-specific installations he drew attention to ecological, geographical, urban and societal issues, recording his actions on video or in photographs. At the same time he was working on a series of stamp paintings in which major events are juxtaposed with the excesses of a bureaucratic system that seems capable of expressing itself only by rubberstamping.\nAcclaimed by international critics and now recognised in the Middle East, his work was presented at the 53rd Venice Biennale\n in 2009 and at the 8th Sharjah Biennial\n in 2007.

He was eight years old when he discovered the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities\n during a class visit, which he would later recall as a turning point in his life. At the age of twenty, he decided to become a sculptor and joined the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo. After he graduated in 1953, he traveled to Upper Egypt and spent several months at the Luxor Atelier established in 1941 by the Alexandrian painter and diplomat Mohammed Naghi (1888 - 1956) to promote the study of ancient Egyptian art as part of the curriculum of art schools in Egypt.\nIn 1957, he received a scholarship for two years to pursue his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts\n in Munich. During one of his exhibitions in 1960, he met the anthropologist Afaf al-Dib, who became his wife and supporter as both manager and critic at the beginning of his career. Henein established his home and studio in 1968 in a mud brick house built by architect Ramsis Wissa Wassef (1911 - 1974) in the village of Harraniyya. In 1971, Henein and his wife moved to Paris, where they stayed for twenty-five years. During that period, he dedicated himself to his art in his studio in the fifteenth arrondissement near Porte de Sèvres. By the time he returned to Egypt in 1996, Henein was an internationally recognized artist. From 1989 to 1998, he worked with the Ministry of Culture\n in restoring the Sphinx in Giza. In 1996, he founded the Aswan International\n Sculpture Symposium, an annual workshop and exhibition inviting sculptors from around the world to experiment and create works from the local granite.\nAdam Henein is one of the most prominent contemporary sculptors of the Arab World. Throughout his career, he produced a considerable number of large and small-scale pieces, using a variety of materials, such as granite, bronze, plaster, limestone and terracotta. His early works embody the graceful solidity of ancient Egyptian statuary and express a sense of simplicity in the treatment of mass and volumes. They recall ancient sculptures, such as the scribe commonly known as the \"Sheikh el-Balad,\" now at the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities\n, as well as the works of Mahmoud Mokhtar (1891 - 1934). During the 1960's, Henein sculpted a series of animals, such as birds, cats, dogs, owls, goats, horses and donkeys, expressing just their minimal and essential lines and features. \nThe beginning of the 1970's marked an important evolution in his art, as a result of being exposed to the work of modern sculptors in Paris, such as Brancusi. Even though Henein never belonged to a specific movement, he was inspired by their freedom of interpretation. During the 1980's, abstract forms, pure volumes and the dynamic of movement characterize his sculptures, centered on the themes of sun and moon disks, as well as vertical ascension. In the 1990's, he worked on several outdoor large-scale sculptures, including The Ship, conceived as a metaphorical alternative to the museum space. Overall, his work embodies a sense of simple monumentality and timelessness.\nHenein has held many individual exhibitions in Cairo, Alexandria, Amsterdam, London, Paris, and Rome, and participated in numerous group exhibitions around the world. His works can be seen at his Museum in Harraniyya inaugurated in January 2014, the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art in Cairo, as well as at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha, which includes his monumental sculpture of The Ship located in front of its entrance.\n   "

His father, Ismaïl Bey Mohammed Wanly was of Turkish origin and his mother, Ismat Hanem al-Daghistani, was from Caucasia. Adham\n grew up, with his four sisters and his elder brother Seif in an aristocratic intellectual francophone environment and was educated by private tutors in the family palace of Urfan Pacha\n . Adham\n worked as the director of the book warehouse at the Education Authority\n in Alexandria.\nWanly first studied oil painting with his brother, Seif, in the studio of the Italian painter Arturo Zanieri (1870 - 1955) who had also been the teacher of Alexandrian painter Mahmoud\n Saïd (1897 - 1964). In 1929, the Italian painter, Ottorino Bicchi (1878 - 1949), educated at the Academy in Florence, opened a studio in Alexandria and the Wanly brothers were among his first students. When Bicchi closed his studio and returned to Italy before the Second World War, the Wanly brothers together with their friends, the painter Ahmad Fahmi and the filmmaker Mohammed Bayoumi, opened their own studio in Alexandria in 1935.\nDuring the 1950's, Adham\n and his brother traveled to many European countries including France, Italy and Spain, where they sketched and painted numerous landscapes, as well as ballet, opera and theater performances. In 1957, the Wanly brothers were appointed as professors at the Faculty of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria founded the same year by the sculptor Ahmad Osman (1907 - 1970). Two years later, they were appointed by the Ministry of Culture\n to participate in recording the Nubian architectural heritage in Aswan before the area was due to be flooded by the construction of the High Dam . During that mission, along with many artists and professors of their generation, they produced numerous paintings and sketches of the Nubian vernacular villages and ancient temples. Adham Wanly died in 1959 at the age of fifty-one in al-Moassat hospital in Alexandria. After his death, the street next to his studio in Alexandria was named after him.\nAdham Wanly, like his brother Seif, was a prolific artist. His early works are influenced by his Italian teacher, Ottorino Bicchi, who was close to the Italian macchiaioli, a group influenced by the French impressionist movement and the École de Barbizon. Bicchi introduced the Wanly brothers to outdoor painting and capturing the light, colors and shades of nature. Adham\n was later influenced by modern pictorial trends, such as cubism and fauvism. Together with his brother, he developed a passion for performance arts, such as circus, ballet and theater and captured the vibrant and dynamic movements of the performers on stage.\nAdham\n also painted numerous landscapes of Alexandria, as well as views of Cairo and many European cities. With his brother Seif, he participated regularly in the Salons in Alexandria and Cairo, as well as in the Alexandria Biennale. In addition to being a painter, he was also a talented caricaturist and during the 1930's, he regularly published his satirical drawings in Egyptian newspapers and reviews, such al Ruz al-Yusuf. His works can be seen at the Seif and Adham Wanly Museum\n hosted in the villa of the Mahmoud Saïd Museum\n in Alexandria, the Museum of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria, the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art in Cairo, the Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha, as well as in numerous private collections around the world.\n   "

After graduating in 1927, he worked with the Mission of the University of Pennsylvania\n as the registrar for the archaeological excavations in Palestine. In 1928, he received a scholarship to study in Rome, where he first took classes at the Scuola Libera del Disegno del Nudo before entering the sculpture section of the Royal Academy\n of Fine Arts\n . After receiving his diploma in 1932, he traveled to Florence to specialize in decorative sculpture at the Regio Instituto d'Arte. The following year, he returned to Egypt where he was appointed professor of sculpture at the School of Applied Arts\n in Giza (former School of Decorative Arts\n ). At that time, the School was directed by the artist Mohammed Hassan (1892 - 1961).\nIn 1937, Osman was named director of the sculpture section of the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo. The same year, he participated in the decoration of the Egyptian Pavilion at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques appliqués à la Vie moderne in Paris, headed by the Egyptian politician and collector Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil (1877 - 1953). In 1938 he exhibited at the fifteenth Venice Biennale\n together with artists Mohammed Naghi (1888 - 1956) and Mahmoud Saïd (1897 - 1964), where Egypt was represented for the first time. Osman left his position at the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo in 1957 to establish the Faculty of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria of which he became the first director.\nBesides his occupations as an artist and teacher, he was involved in the safeguarding of the Egyptian cultural heritage. In 1954, he participated in the relocation of the colossal statue of Ramses II from Mit Rahina (Memphis) to Bab al-Hadid square in front of Cairo railway station. He also participated in Unesco's Nubian campaign from 1959, by developing techniques for cutting and reassembling the stone blocks of the Temple of Abu Simbel.\nAhmad Osman was one of the most prominent Egyptian sculptors of his generation. While his early works employ characteristics of Italian classicism, towards the end of the 1930's he started sculpting a series of bronzes representing busts of Egyptian peasant women. These sculptures are characterized by their realism in depicting the features of the peasants and daily rural activities. They embody the simplicity and joyfulness of rural life, which he often expressed through a smiling Egyptian peasant. Osman also specialized in ornamental sculptures and was commissioned to decorate several public buildings. In 1936, together with his colleague, the sculptor Mansour Farag, he created the reliefs to decorate the entrance gate of the Zoological Garden in Giza designed by architect Mustafa Fahmi (1886 - 1972). In 1947, he sculpted the bronze reliefs decorating the pedestal of the monument to commemorate Ibrahim Pasha on the Opera\n square in Cairo, which was created by the French sculptor Charles Cordier (1829 - 1905).\nUnder Gamal Abdel Nasser, Osman was commissioned to sculpt the exterior façades of the Officers Club\n in Zamalek and the Armed Forces Club\n in Heliopolis, as well as the monumental stylized bronze eagle above the entrance of the Cairo Tower in 1961. Osman was also a talented painter and produced a series of feminine and masculine nudes with charcoal, as well as several portraits, genres he developed while studying at the Scuola Libera del Disegno del Nudo. In his drawings, Osman reflects his background as a sculptor, by applying clear lines and shades on sculptural volumes. His works can be found in private collections, the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art in Cairo, the Agriculture Museum\n in Cairo, the Museum of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria and the Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha.\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Ahmed Cherkaoui was one of the leading modernist painters of Moroccan art in the period after the country gained its independence in 1956. Born in a small town, Boujad, located in the Chaouia plain, Cherkaoui descended, from his father's side, from \"a famous family of mystics\" called the \"Sufi brotherhood of the Cherkaoua.\" The brotherhood was founded in 1566 during the reign of the Saadian sultans. His mother was of Amazighi origin, belonging to the Zayanes tribe from the Middle Atlas. The tribe was known for women's traditionally made handcrafts and wool weaving.\nCherkaoui studied graphics at the École des Metiers d'Art de Paris from 1956 to 1959, and continued his studies at the Aujame Atelier at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts\n de Paris for one year. In 1961, during the political and cultural thaw following the death of Stalin, Cherkaoui moved to Warsaw where he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts\n . Later Cherkaoui returned to Paris, where he won a research grant from UNESCO\n to study signs and symbols in Amazighi art and Arab-Islamic calligraphy. During the early sixties, he held his first one-man show at the Atelier de Lucienne Thalheimer in Paris where he lived and worked.\nCherkaoui created large-scale abstract and symbolic canvases which negotiated an amalgam of references, ranging from Amazighi art, talismanic symbols to Roger Bissière, Paul Klee and Surrealism. The surface of these canvases are covered with burlap onto which Cherkaoui painted black-striped symbols crafted within an oval structure and laid at intervals with bright colors. The Maghreb, \"the place of the setting sun,\" and more specifically the Amazighi tradition of the bare geometric sign are all intrinsic to the artist. Since his young age, his fascination with signs stemmed from his curiosity about the shapes and meaning of his mother's tattoos. Later on, he embraced the teachings and philosophy of Paul Klee, who wrote, \"Man is not a completed product…We must…be open-minded…approach life like a child…of creation, of the creator's,\" and made them a guiding rule of his own spirit.\nThe desire to paint for Ahmed Cherkaoui is partially attributed to his interest in calligraphy and the motifs of popular talismans, and partly to his exposure to 20th century Western Modern art. Consequently, Cherkaoui's works reveal a concrete manifestation of a tangible interplay between tradition and modernity, negotiating both the aesthetic and abstract nature of signs and symbols which govern both Islamic art and new innovative techniques. However, Cherkaoui's resort to signs consists of far more than merely presenting their decorative function. He used a system of geometric signs and ciphers, including triangles, circles, lozenges, dots and broken and curved lines. These signs voice stories about a particular social system that are open to interpretation. As such, his creative artwork presented intriguing and visually complex forms which highlight his profound interest in national heritage.\nIn 1964, Cherkaoui held an exhibition at Jeanne Castel's Gallery in Paris, and other exhibitions in Rabat, Tangier and Casablanca in Morocco, where he explored and developed a personal modern style, he expressed in crude jute collages. After his collages, he went through a phase that he referred to as \"tachiste\" or formlessness, where he emphasized the value of color.\nDuring the early sixties, his artwork depicted various forms drawn from outlines of tattoos, pottery, jewelry, weaving and motifs on handicraft ware, combining both bright and earth colors to highlight the cultural characteristics of his country of origin (al-Maghreb—\"sunset in the sea\"). While dark colors dominated his paintings before 1965, his colors afterwards became lighter and more lustrous with greater awareness of the use of space and additional media such as fiber, gouache and watercolor.\nCherkaoui's works received recognition early on as he won the bronze medal at the 10th \"Salon Interministériel\" in 1962 and took part regularly in the Salon de Mai in Paris. He participated in many solo exhibitions including his one-man show at the Ursula Girardon's Gallery in 1962 in Paris; and numerous collective exhibitions, including \"20 Peintres étrangers\" in the Parisian Musée de l'Art Moderne in 1963.\nCherkaoui taught drawing classes at the Technical College\n in Beaumont-sur-Oise. He was generally associated with a small group of painters in Casablanca including Houssein Tallal and Andre Elbaz although he was never part of the Casablanca School\n . Cherkaoui traveled frequently between Europe and North Africa, and died suddenly due to complications from an appendectomy in 1967 after coming back to Casablanca, Morocco.\nAfter his death, his work was represented in a series of retrospective shows entitled Hommage à Cherkaoui organized at the Biennale de Paris and also at the Salon of Sacred Art in Paris; followed by the Biennale Exhibit of New Delhi in 1968 in India. His works were also featured at the interférences Poetes-Peintres group show at the Daniel Templon Gallery, one of Cherkaoui's watercolor works accompanying the poem 'talisman' written by Jean Guichard Meili in Paris in 1969.\n   "

Done with a subtle skill, Sabri's canvases exhibit the beauty of the landscape and the customs of its inhabitants.    \nSabri completed his early education at the Dar al-Mualimin or the \"House\n of Teachers\" in Baghdad in 1934. He then went on to teach at local schools. Like other artists of his generation, Sabri won a government-sponsored scholarship to pursue the arts in Europe. He travelled to Rome to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in 1937, but was forced to return home at the outbreak of World War II. During the years between 1940 and 1944, Sabri was employed at the Department of Antiquities\n in Baghdad. In 1946, Sabri was again presented with the opportunity to study art abroad and finished his BFA in London at Goldsmiths College\n and the Slade School\n . After graduating in 1950, he held a professorship at the Institute of Fine Art\n in Baghdad, among other institutions. Sabri taught until 1960 and later became Inspector of Fine Arts.\nCoupled with Sabri's institutional affiliations, he was also an active member of several important art groups. He was a founding member of the Society of the Friends\n of Art\n and was active in the Society of Iraqi Plastic\n Artists. He was made a fellow of the latter in 1972. Sabri was one of the pioneer artists to be showcased at the Iraqi artist pavilion during the 1931 Industrial and Agricultural Fair in Baghdad. This was a watershed exhibition for Atta Sabri and his colleagues as it exposed the public to contemporary Iraqi art for the first time. Sabri also participated in the 1950 First Iraqi Art\n Show in London. In 1973, the painter was invited by the German university, Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg\n , to contribute to their craft conference. Subsequently, Sabri contributed to several exhibitions at the National Museum\n of Modern Art\n in Baghdad, especially between 1977 and 1980. In 1979 the museum hosted a major retrospective of Sabri's work.\nThe painter's style remained fairly consistent with a blending of realist and impressionistic qualities. The quiet, blooming crannies in and around Baghdad were Sabri's favored subjects. He also painted sweeping vistas that often contrasts a rocky outcrop with a smooth valley. He rarely focused on individuals, unless composing a portrait. Instead, he centered his canvases on the qualities of the Iraqi environment varying his brushstrokes to reflect movement in the scenery.\nWhen Sabri does focus on human activity the scenes are usually composed as windows into timeless traditions. The viewer stands aloof while passively watching a group of figures interact. Whether it is a cluster of women bathing or musicians playing, a sense of local custom is conveyed through distinctive dress and a ritualized treatment of the portrayed event. There is an overall simplicity and serenity in Sabri's work that can be seen in a number of artists from his generation who were seeking to engage the natural aesthetics of their homeland. \nA number of Atta Sabri's pieces, including his lively rendering of musicians and dancers, were looted from the National Museum\n of Modern Art\n in Baghdad. The artist's son Salam Atta Sabri, the director of the museum and an artist in his own right, has dedicated himself to raising awareness of the fate of these works and is working towards their recovery.\n   "

She mentioned online her interest in Islamic art and Jeem reflects exactly that, but even more so the work left us with the impression that the very best things might well happen outside the greater plan of known geometry.

In 1927, Gemayel traveled to Paris for three years to continue his artistic development at the Academie Julien. During this period, Gemayel developed an admiration for the work of the Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841 - 1919).\nIn 1930, Gemayel returned to Beirut and dedicated himself to his art. In addition to a prolific body of work on paper, Gemayel made substantial contributions to the development in Lebanon of an infrastructure for the visual arts, most notably as a founding member of the Committee of Friends\n of the National Museums and Archaeological Sites (est. 1923) and through his teaching at L'Académie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts (ALBA, est. 1937), where he served as a founding faculty member and at one time director of the department of Art\n and Architecture\n , established in 1943.\nThroughout his career, Gemayel exhibited abroad and in Lebanon, showing regularly at the Parliament\n and the UNESCO\n building in Beirut.

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Born in Ghosta in Mount Lebanon, Corm and his family resettled soon afterwards in his mother's home village of Ghazir. His beginnings as an artist can be dated back to 1861, when two Italian Jesuit priests discovered Corm's drawings on some rocks. Mistaking the young boy's depictions of birds for three-dimensional reality, the priests were mesmerized by Corm's natural talent and offered him a position teaching drawing at the local Jesuit missionary school in exchange for Italian language lessons. After nearly a decade teaching in the school, sometime in the late 1860s Corm sold several paintings to the Maronite Church\n in Mount Lebanon to pay for a ticket to Rome to study at the Accademia di San Luca under artist Roberto Bompiani.\nIn 1878, Corm chose to settle in Beirut. Then part of the Ottoman Empire, the city had undergone radical transformations over the previous decade as it emerged as a commercial, political, and cultural hub in the region. In addition to a population surge following the 1860 civil war in Mount Lebanon, Beirut had grown substantially due to a number of infrastructural projects jointly sponsored by the Ottoman and European governments. In turn, throughout the nineteenth century, a host of families had migrated to Beirut from Aleppo, Damascus, Tripoli, Acre, Sidon and Mount Lebanon to join a growing community of Damascene merchant families. It was from this newly emerging upwardly mobile urban class of merchants, intellectuals, and politicians—known historically as members of al-nahda—that Corm would cultivate a patron base.\nWorking mainly in oil on canvas, along with pastel on paper, Corm depicted Beirut's elite in his signature style: a pared down, formal, three-quarter length portrait against a dark background with an attention to the individual's social and professional standing. In many ways, Corm's work drew on conventions for portraiture previously established both in oil painting and photography, a medium popular among elite at the time. Perhaps Corm's two most recognized portraits are those of Bustros al-Bustani (1894) and Pope Pius IX (early 1870s), which served as Corm's calling card.\nCorm's patrons were not limited to Beirut and Mount Lebanon. Before establishing his atelier in Beirut, Corm spent a period of time in Belgium after being commissioned by Leopold II to paint portraits of the Royal Family of Belgium. In 1887, he traveled to Alexandria to capture with his brush the leading governors there as well as members of the nobility. In 1894, the Khedive Abbas II invited Corm again to Egypt to paint the ruler's portrait.\nIn addition to his portraits, Corm created a substantial body of religious works, the majority of which were commissioned by the Maronite Church\n and many of which remain in churches throughout Mount Lebanon. In fact, before Corm, oil painting was limited to clerics in the church, many of whom had been trained by Italian missionaries and clerics at the Maronite College of Rome\n , established in 1584 to strengthen ties between the Vatican and the region's Christian communities. These cleric-painters, as they have come to be known, include Musa Dib (d.1826), who studied at the Maronite College of Rome\n, and his nephew Kan'an Dib (d. 1873), who along with Corm trained with Constantin Giusti, an Italian painter who had come to Mount Lebanon with the Jesuit missionaries in 1831. Thus, although Corm's academic style may have been outdated in Europe, his historical significance lies in his ability to forge a local market for oil portraits, previously reserved for religious figures. Moreover, the presence of still life, landscapes, and genre scenes within his oeuvre suggests an on spec market for works on canvas and paper.\nIn 1912, Corm expanded his artistic enterprise and its public appeal when he opened Maison d'Art, an art supply store centrally located near Beirut's post office. The store's commercial success indicated a growing public interest not only in art viewing but also in art making.\nCorm exhibited his work abroad in Egypt and Europe, most notably at the 1889 Versailles Exhibition in France and at the 1900 Paris Exhibition, where he received the Prize of Honor of Excellence. Additional recognition of his career includes receipt of the Lebanese Order of Merit and the Ottoman Medal of Glory. Corm died in 1930.\n   "

Persistent in each are his core concerns of geometric abstraction, transparency and the implication of the veil.\nHis large formal landscapes are montages of spaces and places he knows, with human-scale details often omitted. His labyrinthine layering of planes creates space and perspective that is both familiar and confusing. The accuracy Ouadahi's execution belies the fragility of the structures he paints. Ouadahi's fences recall the wire-netting common in the metropolitan suburbs of France and Algeria. They delimit zones into which entrance is not permitted and demarcate privileged zones. Ouadahi's underpasses are the most illusionistic and are based on actual subways in Germany.\nBorn in Casablanca, Morocco, of Algerian parents in 1959, Driss Ouadahi grew up in Algeria. He studied at the Ecole Superieure des Beaux Arts d'Alger before enrolling and subsequently graduating from the Kunstakadamie Düsseldorf, the city where he now lives and works. Ouadahi has exhibited in solo exhibitions in New York, San Francisco, Düsseldorf, Germany, and Istres, France. He has also taken part in a number of group exhibitions, most recently in the 11th edition of the Biennale de l’Art Africain Contemporain, Dakar; 25 Ans De Créativité Arabe, Institute De Monde d’Arab, Paris; Le Retour, 3ème Festival International\n d'Art Contemporain d'Alger; Magreb: Dos Orillas, Círculo de Bellas Artes, Madrid; Future of a Promise at Venice Bienale 54, Cairo Biennial\n 12, and CU Art Museum\n , University of Colarado\n in Boulder.\n   "

As a master of art education and head of such education in north Jeddah his proficiency in handling oils and perhaps acrylic paint should be judged self evident, but surprising is how many paintings he shows in his presentation on facebook. They number hundreds and with consistency of vision and of life, sometimes changing the subject to calligraphy or horses. Occasionally Al-Khalif explores a naïve realism or his usual abstract style with more subdued colours. Some of his works appear to be wallpaintings by themselves or to have been assembled with square canvasses brought together to match. All these are styles and themes not unusual in the country, but Al-Khalif easily convinces as being master of any caravan.Al-Khalif mentiones many exhibitions in Jeddah and many in countries in Europe representing his country.

During his artistic career he took on many roles within the burgeoning Iraqi art scene, including educator and founder. In the crucial decades of the 1940s and 50s, Hassan was devoted to the creation of an art form that would express the growing feelings of national pride amongst Iraqi citizens. He was also interested in developing his own technical skill and that of his students. In later decades, Hassan would remain a leading artist in Iraq and his artistic legacy continues to be a powerful influence.\nBorn in Baghdad in 1914, Hassan remembers his childhood as a series of art experiments, as he would master one media and move on to the next. A typical experiment involved mud from the Tigris River sculpted in the shape of horses and people. He did not consider himself bright in the traditional sense as he neglected his schoolwork. His talent for art-making, however, developed with ease and he was encouraged by his teachers. One teacher in particular, the artist Muhammad Khidir, became Hassan's mentor and artistic example. He considered Khidir a master of color subtleties, whose work would later point the way for Hassan's own investigations into color theory.\nHassan's artistic aptitude was awarded in 1933 when he became the second recipient of a government-funded scholarship to study art in Europe. He travelled to France and enrolled at the Ècole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. In Paris, Hassan had a fairly traditional education in the arts. He participated in art history and studio classes while completing art projects based on copying master works. Hassan was also introduced to important figures of European modernism. He was especially impressed with artists like Matisse and Delacroix, paying specific attention to their use of color. Like many art students, Hassan spent his years in Paris synthesizing aspects of his education and life experiences into a workable artistic practice. Thus, these were days of exploration and a growing awareness of the international art scene.\nHassan returned to Baghdad after receiving his degree in 1938. Soon after, he accepted a position at the Institute of Fine Art\n in Baghdad as the director of the Department of Painting\n and Sculpture\n . During his tenure at the institute, which continued until 1962, Hassan introduced courses based on Western painting techniques, as well as classes for the study of Islamic and Arab folk arts, like pottery and metalwork. He also went to great lengths to develop the efficacy of the department by training future teachers and procuring basic art supplies and gypsum models. In conjunction with his job as an administrator, Hassan was an involved teacher. He taught courses on color theory, perspective, anatomy, and design, as well as classes in art history. He encouraged his students to search their local surroundings for inspiration while honing their technical skills. Hassan took student development as a personal responsibility and made it his duty to oversee the first generation of artists to graduate from the institute. Over the next decade, the institute became the center of artistic activity and Hassan's reputation as a leading figure in Iraqi art education was firmly established.\n   "

We do not recognize him and only see a man's upper body from behind with a white sheet pulled over it. His face is and will remain hidden througout the performance. He nevertheless turns to face his viewers and picks up the loose ends of the sheet and starts winding them around his head. This goes on for a while with both or changing hands. When the sheet is all wrapped around the head and shoulders, he doesn't stop but continues only to wrap things differently and more firmly, sometimes passing stages that look like he has a bird's beak or is a severly wounded hospital patient. After a while he simply walks away with the sheet still in place. Such is the video installation Samra presents on his website as Distorted Reality (improvisation).\nSamra believes he is arming people against the beautified 'made-up images' which are produced by ad-men and news editors to flatter and deceive us into making the wrong choices. He thinks these image producers wage a ruthless war on us and on many levels, but he has said in an interview that it was the role of the media in justifying the actual 'War on Terror' that made up his mind to start the body of work that is Distorted Reality. He uses digital photography, computer graphics and video to record these improvised and mostly very similar performances. They are also presented in a photographic format as a triptych. The cloth or cloths may be more colourful and he may add a number of props, but they all tell of a struggle with images we hold close to our heads. A skinned lamb appears in one of them. He has been quoted as saying that this was a memory from watching a lamb being slaughtered with Eid Al-Adha when he was only four years old and starting to draw. Samra's own distorted realities are not about beautifying the worse but perhaps a better which is to question our resistance against images. \nFaisal Samra (1956) was born and lives in Bahrain. He has the Saudi Arabian nationality and has worked in Saudi Arabia for a number of years after graduating with honours from the Ecole National\n Superieure des Beaux Arts in Paris in 1980. He has been a fine arts and graphics consultant with the Institut du Monde Arabe\n . He has explored Islamic design in Marocco and lived and worked in Lebanon and Jordan. He ventured upon his DistortedRealities after having been artist in residence (2005) at the Cité International\n des Arts in Paris. Earlier work of Samra involved among other things canvas 'released' from the frame and wrapped around wire mesh. This older work is included in the Al-Mansouria foundation collection. Samra is the Saudi Arabian artist best known in the international circuit. He has in 2008 shown his work in the Edge of Arabia\n exhibition in London and on the Singapore Biennale\n .\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      One of the foremost modernist artists in Morocco, Farid Belkahia began his training at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts of Paris from 1954 to 1959. He continued his studies in Prague until returning to Morocco in 1962 to become director of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Casablanca, a position he retained until 1974. Belkahia turned away from oil painting and easels in the early 1960s and began working primarily with large-scale hammered copper. While retaining multiple dimensions, the copper was meant to be hung on walls and was used to create bas-reliefs. Since the mid-1970s, Belkahia is best known for the work he has done with leather, which he treats using traditional techniques and stretches over shaped supports. He then paints the leather with naturally occurring dyes such as henna.\nThe process of the work on both copper and leather is for Belkahia an important aspect of the creation of his art, and his work typically highlights not just the organic shapes that make up the content of the work, but the texture and dimensionality of the materials themselves. He has a consistent and carefully theorized taxonomy of symbols, shapes, and materials that resurface throughout his oeuvre. Belkahia's work typically uses sinuous, organic shapes that recall bodies or corporality. Many of his works use triangles, arrows, and hands, and often involve questions of sexuality. He often employs Tifinagh letters from the Amazigh alphabet and symbols culled from traditional visual culture within Morocco, derived from rugs, tattoos, and architecture. Part of the interest of his work, however, is the way in which these symbols are re-constituted and re-imagined to become an integral part of his modernist visual vocabulary.\nBelkahia was an active voice in the debates around post-colonial artistic modernism in Morocco, and contributed to   the leftist cultural and intellectual journal Souffles when it first came out. For Belkahia, using the cultural heritage of Morocco in his shapes, materials, and technique was a way of rooting international modernism within the local context. Under his leadership, the Casablanca Ecole des Beaux-Arts became known for advancing a pedagogy that turned away from the inherited French model of easel paintings and still lifes, instead highlighting Moroccan visual culture and architecture. The pedagogy of the art school was closely linked to the artists' broader activities. With the artists Mohammed Melehi and Mohammed Chebaa (both of whom taught at the school), he formed the Casablanca group that first exhibited together in Rabat in 1966. In 1969, these artists along with three other professors from the school organized the \"exposition manifeste\" in Djemaa al-Fna in Marrakech, an open-air exhibition that sought direct contact with a larger public outside of official arts spaces. Later that same year, a similar exhibition was held in the Place du 16 Novembre in Casablanca.\nBelkahia has had multiple personal exhibitions at major art venues in Morocco, including the national gallery, Galerie Bab Rouah, in Rabat, the Galerie L'Atelier in Rabat, the Cultural Moussem of Asilah, the Batha Museum of Fes\n, and the Galerie Delacroix in Tangier. He has also had international solo exhibitions including those at Darat al Funun (Amman)\n and the Musée d'Art Moderne et Contemporain (Nice). His work was represented in  major early exhibitions of Moroccan modern art, including \"2000 ans d'art au Maroc\" (Galerie Charpentier, Paris) and the 1963 Rencontre International\n in Rabat, as well as the Paris Biennale (1959 and 1961), the Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar (1966), the Panafrican Festival in Algiers (1967), and the First Arab Biennial in Baghdad (1974). More recently, his art was included in the exhibitions \"Présences artistiques du Maroc\" (Maison de la Culture, Grenoble, 1985), \"Quatre peintures du Maroc\" (Institut du Monde Arabe\n , Paris, 1991), \"Interventions\" (Mathaf, 2009), and at the Museum of Modern Art\n (Johannesberg), the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (Berlin), and the Biennales of Venice and Lyon.\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Gamal el-Sigini was a sculptor and medalist born in the neighborhood of Bab al-Shaariya in Cairo. He grew up near the Khan al-Khalili market and was impressed as a child by the craftsmanship of the metalworkers and goldsmiths established in this area. He joined the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo in 1933, where he studied under the Saint Petersburg born Swedish sculptor Boris Frödman-Cluzel (1878 - 1959). In 1937, el-Sigini won the Mahmoud Moukhtar Prize for sculpture, which was created by intellectual and feminist Huda Shaarawi in 1935 to commemorate the death of the renowned sculptor, Mahmoud Mokhtar (1891 - 1934). El-Sigini graduated in 1938, and in 1945 founded the Group Sawt al-Fannān (The Voice of the Artist) that promoted young Egyptian artists and inspired the art critic Muhammad Sidqi al-Gabakhangi to establish a monthly art review with the same name.\nEl-Sigini traveled to Paris at his own expense and discovered the works of Rodin, Brancusi, Bourdelle and Maillol. In Egypt, he was a member of the Group of Modern Art\n founded in 1947 with his contemporaries; Hamed Owais, Gazbia Sirry, Zeinab Abdel Hamid, Salah Yousri and Youssef Sida. The same year, el-Sigini received a scholarship to pursue his studies in metalwork and sculpture in Rome. When he returned to Egypt in 1951, he established his studio in the neighborhood of Zamalek and was appointed as a professor of sculpture at the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo. In 1958, he moved to Alexandria to head the department of sculpture at the Faculty of Fine Arts\n just after its creation by sculptor Ahmad Osman (1907 - 1970). El-Sigini left this post in 1964, when he was named director of the section of sculpture at the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo. In 1969, because his works and those of his contemporaries were not commissioned for public spaces, he threw a number of his sculptures into the Nile to express his frustration. El-Sigini traveled to Spain for his last exhibition at the Center for Mediterranean Studies in Barcelona, where he died in November 1977 at the age of sixty.\nGamal el-Sigini produced numerous works, using a diversity of materials, such as bronze, stone, copper, wood and leather. He developed an original technique of hammered red copper for executing low-reliefs inspired by ancient Egyptian art. From the 1950's, he sculpted social realist works dealing with intensely idealistic and patriotic themes. Although the message of his works was often political, el-Sigini created a poetic style characterized by the introduction of symbols, such as the dove or the snake, as well as his own calligraphy using the signs of an imaginary language. He sculpted allegorical reliefs of several places in Egypt, such as the Nile, Alexandria or Cairo, and often interpreted the image of motherhood as a representation of his homeland.\nA recurrent subject in his work used as a symbol of Egypt is the carūsa, a bridal sugar-doll traditionally sold on the occasion of the celebration of the birth of the Prophet (mawlid al-nabawī). After the defeat of the Six-Day War in 1967, el-Sigini, like many artists of his generation, expressed his disillusion and despair in his work. He conveyed this through the figure of a mutilated or hanged carūsa. El-Sigini produced several statues of Egyptian public figures and in 1958, won the governmental competition for the monument of the poet Ahmad Shawqi (1868 - 1932) to be placed in the gardens of the Villa Borghese in Rome. Two copies of this sculpture stand today in Cairo in front of the poet's Museum and inside the Opera\n House\n \t.\nBesides being a sculptor, el-Sigini was a talented medalist and produced numerous medals in copper, silver and gold for various official occasions, such as the medals of the Alexandria Biennale from 1955 until the end of the 1970's. He also designed projects for monuments, such as the reliefs for the monument of the Unknown Soldiers in Port Saïd and a monument of the October Victory, which was intended to be placed at the entrance of the Suez Canal but was finally not executed. El-Sigini is the author of a series of paintings inspired by rural life, sail boats and the figure of the carūsa. His works can be seen at the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art\n in Cairo, the Opera\n House\n in Cairo, the gardens of the Villa Borghese in Rome, as well as in the Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha.\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      George Daoud Corm was a distinguished painter and francophone poet and writer. In both his artwork and writings, Corm expressed a dedication to the classical tradition of European humanism and Christian ethics.\nThe son of painter Daoud Corm, Georges D. Corm was born into an artistic family and expressed an equal interest in painting and writing. Although he published his first poem in 1915, Corm eventually chose to train as a professional visual artist, attending the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts\n from 1919 to 1921. Upon his return to Beirut, Corm received immediate recognition for his paintings, having been honored with the Gold Medal at the 1921 Beirut Exhibition Fair. A year later, he won a competition for his proposal for the Lebanese Medal of Merit.\nDevoted to Lebanon and its cultural enrichment as a nascent nation, Corm worked diligently to promote the arts. He served as a founding member of the committee for the Museum of Antiquities\n (1922 - 1928), jury member for both the Lebanese National\n Conservatory of Music and Committee\n for the Lebanese National\n Anthem, and as secretary for the 1926 International Archeological Congress\n in Beirut.\nIn 1928, with his marriage to Marie Bekhit, Corm left Beirut to live for a period of time in Egypt, first in Alexandria and later Cairo. Active in the Egyptian art scene, Corm helped establish in 1934 the \"Atelier,\" a collective dedicated to the promotion of arts and letters.\nCorm and Marie returned in 1956 to Beirut, by which time recognition of his artistic accomplishment was both local and international. Corm had become an officer of the Academy of France\n in 1936 and was elected as an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Arts\n in London in 1955. He became an Officer of the Lebanese National\n Order of the Cedar in 1958 and received numerous awards and honors throughout his lifetime.\nCorm's paintings, predominantly oil on canvas and pastel on paper, document the importance of portraiture in Lebanon throughout the first half of the twentieth century, a market which his father painter Daoud Corm had worked to establish. The subjects of George Corm's portraits range from royalty and figures in high society, who commissioned his work, to everyday people, including several fellaheen, or peasants. He also completed a significant number of self-portraits, the most interesting of which capture Corm in his position as a painter and document an increasing awareness of the social status of the artist in twentieth century Lebanon.\nIn many ways, Corm's academic style recalls the work of his father, particularly in those pieces in which the artist sets the figure against a simple, darkly shaded background. However, Corm's formal language also moves away from the conventions of the previous generation as witnessed in his use of a lighter palette and looser brushwork. Such aesthetic shifts are most evident in Corm's still life and landscapes. Moreover, Corm's oeuvre includes a substantial number of nudes, a staple of European academic painting and a genre favored by this generation of Lebanese artists, including Corm's great contemporary, the painter César Gemayel (1898 - 1958). Corm's most distinctive work is in the genre of landscape. In addition to a series of more conventional landscapes of Lebanon's mountain ranges and coastline, Corm began during the early fifties to experiment with landscapes infused with spirituality, otherworldliness, and hidden symbolism.\nThroughout his career as a painter, Corm continued to write and publish poetry, essays, and criticism. In 1966, he published his most well-known piece, Essai sur l'art et la civilization de ce temps, in which Corm articulates an aesthetic position in the midst of a radically divided cold war culture. Critical of both American consumerism and Marxist Communism, Corm advocates a return to a classical European tradition of Humanism, rooted in Christian ethics. Corm's deep commitment to humanism and Christianity is evident in his paintings, which consistently feature the human figure as well as what critics have termed, \"paysages d'âme,\" or spiritual landscapes.\nCorm exhibited extensively in Beirut and Europe, and participated in in the 1966 Spring Salon in Paris. He died in Beirut on December 13, 1971. He was honored with a retrospective of his work in 1981 at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry\n in Beirut and in 2013 with the exhibition, \"Lebanese Painterly Humanism: Georges D. Corm,\" at the American University of Beirut Art Gallery\n .\n   "

He was educated at the Collège des Pères Jésuites in Cairo before his father, Hanna Sabbagh Bey, one of the stakeholders of the Heliopolis urban development project, sent him to Paris in 1906 to study law. During that period, Georges Sabbagh showed little interest in his studies and instead started to take painting lessons at the Académie Ranson in 1910. There he was trained by the painters Paul Sérusier (1864 - 1927), Félix Vallotton (1865 - 1925) and Maurice Denis (1870 - 1943). From that time on, he dedicated himself entirely to art.\nDuring the First World War, between 1914 and 1915, Sabbagh enrolled in the British army. On his return to France, in 1916 he married the art historian and political activist Agnès Humbert (1894 -1 963), with whom he had two sons, Pierre and Jean. The same year, he spent several months in the Silencio villa of Maurice Denis located in the small village of Perros-Guirec in Brittany, the sole region of the Nabis and the painters of the École de Pont-Aven.  In 1917, Sabbagh held his first individual exhibition at the Galerie Chéron in Paris, which was a success. From then on, he became a renowned painter in Paris and was in touch with many of the artists working during the interwar period in the French capital, such as Modigliani, Jules-Emile Zingg, and Yves Alix and Henry de Waroquier.\nIn 1920, on the death of his mother, he returned to Egypt for the first time after more than ten years in Paris. While in Egypt, he produced several paintings addressing the themes of motherhood and family. He returned to France in 1922 and traveled regularly to Crozant, to visit his friend, the painter Armand Guillaumin (1841 - 1927). In 1928, he built a house in Ploumanac'h in Brittany close to the villa of Maurice Denis that inspired several of his paintings. Sabbagh became a French citizen in 1930. He left France to return to Egypt in 1936 and lived there until 1945. During that period, he produced many landscapes, townscapes as well as still lifes. In 1951, he traveled to Switzerland where he held exhibitions in Geneva and Lausanne and died in Paris the same year, on the 9th of December.\nGeorges Sabbagh spent most of his life in Paris, where he built his career. Although he was very attached to his Egyptian origins, he considered himself a painter of the École de Paris. He was a prolific artist, who produced over a thousand oil paintings as wel​l as many engravings. His early paintings are marked by the lessons of the Nabis, particularly by his teacher and friend, Maurice Denis, who initiated him into the emotional power of color and symbolism. Sabbagh, along with some of his contemporaries working in Paris, such as his friends Yves Alix and Jules-Emile Zingg, belonged to what the critic Jean Cassou called \"the sacrificed generation.\" These artists assimilated the experiences of the Nabis, the Cubists and the Fauves, while searching for a new form of Realism. In 1918, he paid tribute to his forefathers, by representing Cézanne and Van Gogh in his painting entitled Les joueurs de cartes.\nOverall, Sabbagh remained independent and original in his pictorial style, by continuously following modern trends while expressing the powerful light and colors of his country of origin. He painted many portraits of his contemporaries, friends, and family, as well as marines of Brittany and landscapes of the Egyptian, French and Swiss countryside. During his lifetime, Sabbagh held twenty-eight individual exhibitions and participated in more than 130 collective exhibits. He held one of his last exhibitions at the Galerie Motte in Geneva in 1951. After his death, many retrospective exhibitions where organized in his honor and in 1981, Pierre and Jean Sabbagh dedicated a monograph to their father that shed light on his life, work and career. His works can be seen in many collections around the world, including the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art\n in Cairo, the Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum\n in Cairo and the Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha. In 2013, several works of Georges Sabbagh were presented in the exhibition \"Tea with Nefertiti\" held at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha and at the Institut du Monde Arabe\n in Paris under the title \"Le Théorème de Nefertiti.\"\n   "

Yet he was also an active painter who possessed a talent for capturing the beauty of everyday life through a sophisticated manipulation of form and color. Al-Droubi is considered one of the pioneers of Iraqi modern art as he made several early contributions to its development. \nAl-Droubi began his formal education in the arts at the Accademia Reale in Rome, becoming one of the first Iraqi artists to study abroad. He would later earn a degree from Goldsmiths College\n in London in 1950. After his studies in Rome, he returned to Iraq and became an active participant in the burgeoning art scene. During the formative years between studying in Rome and London, Al-Droubi took several steps to professionalize art practice in Iraq. In 1941, he established Iraq's first free artist studio, which gave aspiring artists a space to learn and practice art-making. In the subsequent decade, Al-Droubi opened similar artist studios at the Faculty of Arts\n and Sciences at Baghdad University\n , where he could supervise and encourage emerging talent. Many other studios like these opened around Baghdad, each headed by established artist. This system proved highly effective as many notable Iraqi artists received their early training from these ateliers.\nHafidh al-Droubi was a crucial figures in the development of modernism in Iraq, especially in the realm of art education. In the course of a career that included service in important positions like the Deanship of the Academy of Fine Arts\n in Baghdad and the Chair of the Society of Iraqi Plastic\n Arts\n \t, he demonstrated a deep commitment to providing knowledge and resources for succeeding generations. Indeed, he was instrumental in instilling the value of art education among his student and colleagues. \nAl-Droubi's work can be appreciated today in many settings around the world, including museums, government buildings, and universities; foremost among these sites is Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha, Qatar and the Jordan National\n Gallery of Fine Art\n in Amman, Jordan. His works were also held at the Iraqi Museum of Modern Art\n in Baghdad. Many of these were looted from the museum's collection and have yet to be recovered.\n   "

Her compositions subtly belie their own errors and form what she calls a ‘natural abstract language’.\nRedjaian believes that these works, nimble yet systematic, refer in part to the manner in which people create, adapt to and deviate from order in their lives. She will often base her drawings on a precise background, such as grid paper, and weave graphite into its rigid structures with rough shadings and free-radical lines. Conversely, Redjaian may overlay two pieces of grid paper, drawing directly onto their discordant lines, creating a paradoxical order in the result.\nA similar approach can be seen in the artist’s textiles, for which she appropriates carpets made in Kerman, Iran, and lightly stitches patterns onto them. The irregularities in these hand-knotted carpets contrast with the long, smooth lines of thread she stitches over the top. A conversation of abstraction takes place within the threads of the fabric, between these two hand-made yet very different systems.\nRedjaian’s recent solo exhibitions include; Same Same but different, (2013) at Vincenz Sala, Berlin, and Friday Night Lights, Sox, Berlin. She also participated in Blossom on the tree you know how I feel (2013), a dual exhibition with Henry Kleine at September, Berlin.

As the son of a sheikh, he was raised in a religious environment and was profoundly influenced in his childhood by the everyday life of the areas of al-Khalifa and Sayyida Zeinab. In the beginning of the 1940's, he was a student at the Secondary School of Hilmiyya\n (then Faruk Ist School\n ) where he developed an interest in art, psychology and philosophy. During that time, he met the painter and pedagogue Hussein Youssef Amin (1904 - 1984) who was teaching drawing in secondary schools. Amin had rejected the academic system of the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo and adopted a new method of art education, based on the individual development and freedom of expression of his students. This experience gave birth to the Group of Contemporary Art\n in which many of Amin's pupils such as Hamed Nada, Abdel Hadi el-Gazzar, Ibrahim Massouda, Maher Raif, Kamal Youssef, Salim el-Habashi, Samir Rafi and Mahmoud Khalil were included. The group held its first exhibition in May 1946 at the Lycée Français in Cairo, presenting around 200 works mostly portraying popular life in Egypt and touching on social concerns.\nIn 1948, Nada joined the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo, where he studied under the painters Ahmed Sabry (1889 - 1955) and Youssef Kamel (1891 - 1971) and graduated in 1951. During his studies, he contributed as an illustrator and critic to the literary review, Al-Thaqafa, together with prominent writers and poets such as Taha Hussein and Louis Awad. In 1956, he was a member of the Luxor Atelier, which was created in 1941 by Alexandrian\n painter Mohammed Naghi (1888 - 1956) to promote the study of ancient Egyptian art by art students. Nada stayed in Luxor for one year, observing and studying the frescoes and reliefs of the temples in the Valley of Thebes. When he returned to Cairo in 1957, he was appointed professor of painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria the year it was founded by the sculptor Ahmad Osman (1907 - 1970). In 1960, Nada received a scholarship to study mural painting at the Royal Academy\n of Fine Arts\n of San Fernando in Madrid. After obtaining his diploma in 1961, he was appointed as a professor at the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo and became the head of the painting department in 1977. He continued to work part-time as a teacher after his retirement in 1984 and died on the 27th of May 1990 after a fall in his studio in al-Ghuriyya during a power shortage.\nHamed Nada is one of the most prominent painters of the Group of Contemporary Art\n. He was one of the first modern Egyptian artists, along with his colleague and friend, the painter Abdel Hadi al-Gazzar, to introduce superstitious symbols and to express human psychology and unconscious fear in his paintings. His early works are strongly influenced by the social environment of the popular areas of Cairo, from which his teacher, Hussein Youssef Amin, encouraged him to draw his inspiration. Nada developed a symbolist pictorial universe nourished by legends of storytellers, popular beliefs and superstitions, as well as the magical and mysterious world of djins. His works from the 1950's depict interior scenes of poor communal households, expressing the intimacy of human resignation and fatalism. As a metaphor of the human soul, the cat, the lamp and the chair are recurrent symbols in his paintings. During the 1960's, after closely studying the arts of Ancient Egypt while a resident at the Luxor Atelier, Nada's work started to unfold into two -dimensional spaces animated by stylized and distorted human figures. He also used brighter colors to represent scenes of Egyptian daily life and political subjects. In these works, one can sometimes discern the influence of Ragheb Ayad (1892 - 1982), though Nada brought the representation of popular culture to a symbolist and universal level by painting poetic tales of the intimate lives of working-class Egyptians. His works can be seen at the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art\n in Cairo, the Museum of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria, Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha, as well as in numerous private collections all around the world.\n   "

There, he received his primary and secondary education before working as a metalworker. He soon realized he was not fit for this profession and moved to Cairo, where he joined the School of Fine Arts\n. After he graduated in 1944, he pursued his studies at the Institute of Art Education\n in Cairo, where he was trained by the pedagogue and critic Youssef el-Afifi. He received his diploma in 1946 and in the following year, he founded the Group of Modern Art\n , together with other artists of his generation, such as Gamal el-Sigini, Gazbia Sirry, Zeinab Abdel Hamid, Salah Yousri and Youssef Sida.\nFrom 1948 to 1955, Owais worked as a drawing teacher in the Farouk Ist Secondary School\n in Alexandria. He traveled to Italy in 1952 and visited the Venice Biennale\n where the works of Italian Social Realist artists were being exhibited. In 1958, he was appointed a professor at the Faculty of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria just after it was founded by the sculptor Ahmad Osman (1907 - 1970). In 1967, Owais received a scholarship to continue his studies at the Royal Academy\n of Fine Arts\n of San Fernando in Madrid where he received his diploma in 1969. From 1977 to 1979, he served as the head of the Faculty of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria. He died in Cairo in 2011, at the age of ninety-two.\nHamed Owais is one of the leading Social Realist painters in Egypt. His work embodies the struggle of the people of the Egyptian working class: peasants, fishermen, laborers, factory workers, craftsmen, barbers, builders and market sellers. He was one of the first Egyptian artists to address the question of unemployment and the everyday life of Egyptian laborers in the 1940's and 1950's. His work was strongly influenced by the ideas of the Group of Modern Art\n, whose members rejected Surrealism, as they believed that art should touch the masses and clearly reflect social ideologies. Owais, like other artists of his generation, such as Gamal el-Sigini, was a partisan of the ideals of the 1952 revolution, which he expressed in his works. He admired the European modernists such as Picasso and Matisse and found affinity with Mexican Social Realists, such as the muralists Diego Rivera (1886 - 1957) and David Alfaro Siqueiros (1896 - 1974).\nOwais developed a clear and direct style portraying the life of the average Egyptian worker. His peasants or fishermen are massive and muscular, which reflects the strength of his social convictions. Their large bodies often seem to be enclosed in the reduced space of the canvas that appears as a metaphor of the social boundaries of the Egyptian society. When he moved to Alexandria, Owais was influenced by the abundance of light and vibrant colors of the Mediterranean port, as well as by the work of Alexandrian painter Mahmoud Saïd (1897 - 1964). Although Hamed Owais is commonly associated with the socialist ideology of the Gamal Abdel Nasser era, his original style and work overall reflect his humanist character.\nOwais' work can be seen in the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Arts\n in Cairo, the Museum of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria, as well as in Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha. Although Hamed Oweis is one of the most prominent Egyptian artists of his generation, only a few studies have as yet been devoted to his life and work, which merit being documented in greater depth.\n   "

This is a space where masculine poetry is mastered by learning and examination and from where travel is possible in both directions. In Jeddah the artist may land herself as a philosophical doctor of visual technology and in Washington she may arrive as a true master of calligraphy. She has earned both these qualifications. The artist-researcher and teacher will not have herself pinned down in a single category. She 'chooses to bounce between image and text,' is what she writes on her website, and to this should be added that she believes good restaurants should manage to serve a large menu. Her art ranges from painting in several genres, such as portrait, landscape, still life and calligraphy, to mixed media installations and performances. In none of it however she will represent women 'physically' as was often done in the history of western figurative art. Her George Mason University\n master thesis installation Birdwatcher (2004) seemed to mock such orientalist paintings as Ingres's Grande Odalisque or anything of the like by Matisse and other artists who are central to the western canon of art. In fact Orientalism itself might qualify as 'birdwatching' if you come to think of it. Huda Totonja would have disappointed the oriental minded gentlemen in their London and Parisian chambers and clubs. Her giant birdcage was empty and only feathers and hairpins were left for such eager-to-collect and very civilised men. So was it about Iraq and Afghanistan? The artist probably never intended it to be like that. But, whoever thought that there would be a giant bird of wings, bones and flesh to be caught in that war, might have better reviewed Totonja's empty cage first. This is what she says: that the female vision is central to what she makes.\nunder construction]\n   "

The embroideries in Raad’s most recent series contain extracts from the poem Shah-nameh by Persian poet Ferdowsi (940-1020 CE). The poem describes existence shadowed by the horrors of demons, as well as life free of them. Raad transforms the meaning of the demon texts, transforming the setting of the words to his colourful and richly sources visual language. He mocks, taunts, and challenges, presenting playful offerings of hope as well as despair and criticism.\nRaad lives and works in Tehran, where he has worked in the field of Graphic Design\n for many years.

Mein’s works range in media and include works on paper, canvas and textile, and stop motion animation to reveal the ruptures between source material and the images they produce. Her broader body of work contends with the surface, structure and materiality of image and resists actual narratives that frame her subject matter. As such, the medium becomes deeply implicated in the depicted subject, whether it be obsolete paper billboards from her hometown São Paulo or the movement and labor of bodies within social and physical spaces. In each of these instances error, accident and imperfection are foregrounded even as Mein challenges the speed that drives contemporary visual culture by utilizing meticulous drawing and cutting techniques to construct her work.\nMein exhibits internationally, including solo shows at Simon Preston Gallery (New York) November 2013; Galeria Leme (São Paulo, Brazil); The Pavilion Downtown (Dubai)\n; and major group exhibitions at Julia Stoschek Foundation (Germany)\n; Museo Tamayo\n de Arte Contemporáneo (Mexico); and The Street Files Biennial El Museo\n del Barrio (New York) among others.

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Jilali Gharbaoui began taking painting classes while in secondary school in Fes, at the Académie des Arts. With the support of the novelist Ahmed Sefrioui, director of fine arts in Rabat, Gharbaoui was able to receive a scholarship to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Paris, where he took classes with Jean Souverbie and often visited the atelier La Grande Chaumière. He studied an additional year in Rome, and often returned to Paris, where he was introduced as part of the \"groupe des informels\" at the Salon Comparaison in 1959 by art critic Pierre Restany. He was particularly influenced by classical Flemish painting after a trip to Amsterdam in 1962. Gharbaoui suffered from severe mental illness, and was hosted on multiple occasions by Father Denis Martin at the monastery of Toumliline in the Middle Atlas Mountains. In the late 1960s, major Moroccan art collector Abderrahman Serghini bought a large part of his works and studio. Like other Moroccan artists at the time, Gharbaoui's extensive travels were motivated by the lack of infrastructure and support for the arts in Morocco, and he was outspoken about these issues in print, as in the 1967 \"fiches et questionnaires\" in the leftist cultural journal Souffles. In 1971, Gharbaoui's body was found on a public bench in the Champ de Mars. His body was repatriated to Morocco by André Malraux, and he is buried in Fes.\nIn Gharbaoui's short lifetime, he played a major role in furthering the debates around Moroccan modernism. Along with Ahmed Cherkaoui, Jilali Gharbaoui is considered one of the founders of modernism in Morocco. While Gharbaoui felt himself and his art to be deeply influenced by Morocco, particularly by the colors of Moroccan earth, it was not in the direct and traceable way of Cherkaoui's work. Many contemporaneous Moroccan artists, such as Farid Belkahia and Mohammed Melehi, worked to root their modernist abstractions in the signs and symbols of Moroccan visual culture. Unlike his contemporaries, however, Gharbaoui distanced himself from these debates, centering his work on the gesture of painting itself. Although Gharbaoui worked with both sculpture and painting, he is best known for the striking colors and violent brush-strokes of his gestural abstractions on canvas, paper, and wood. Very early works by Gharbaoui are relatively representational or focus on geometric abstraction, but later works are easily identified by a consistent style of loose abstract work that focuses on the movement of the brush itself. The paintings deliberately highlight the hand of the artist and often build up texture through thick layers of paint, showcasing both the interplay of colors and lines as well as the materiality of the paint itself.\nDuring his lifetime, Gharbaoui exhibited widely in Morocco and internationally, in Egypt, France, the Netherlands, the United States, and Brazil. As part of the \"groupe des informels,\" Gharbaoui participated in an exhibition that moved to Japan, Mexico, and Germany.  Particularly since the 1990s, Gharbaoui's importance has been celebrated through a number of exhibitions and books. Gharbaoui was the focus of a 1993 retrospective at the Institut du Monde Arabe\n, as well as the monograph Fulgurances Gharbaoui by Yasmina Filali, published the same year in Casablanca. A film on Gharbaoui was additionally commissioned by Filali and the IMA\n by Faten Safieddine. Within Morocco, the Museum Bank\n Al-Maghrib (2011) and the Villa des Arts/Fondation ONA of Rabat and Casablanca (2010) have also hosted large retrospectives of Gharbaoui's work.\n   "

In Massachusetts she was thoroughly educated in the arts and most interestingly started with film theory to end with mixed media at the school of The Museum of Fine Arts\n in Boston. Presently her American home appears to be New York.Al-Saud's work can be seen on her own website and on sites of several galleries in London, New York and soon in Berlin and even Amsterdam. Of these websites only the artist's own site allows us to have a look at older work like White Trash Barbie and a harrowing fantasy of Orlando Barbie murders in what looks like a set designed for the Thunderbirds starring in a Hitchcock movie.\nOn her website Al-Saud allows us not only older work, but also more words than galleries usually find necessary. They are about her current project, which is a series by the name of 'Out of line.' Again, it looks like a storyboard, but this time the movie is not about reality dolls but about the real lives of Saudi's whose pictures have been brought in line with demands of censorship on showing personal imagery. For this the artist has removed their skin and faces. The people in the images may however not really be bothered by any official censorship. Foreign stamps and airmail letters imply they are mostly 'out of border' living Saudi's, which raises a question. Is it the official, sometimes silly, censorship in KSA that Al-Saud was dealing with or is it perhaps the universal struggle every artist has with telling all without implicating family and friends, who prefer privacy over the stage? It seems that where the official censor stays within the borders of KSA this unofficial one reaches far beyond such lines.About the adapted work the artist writes: 'when reduced to sketches, the images achieved enough distance from the original photographs that neither subjects nor censors could find them objectionable. For me, they became autonomous, relatable, pared down narratives.' And she adds a note on photography in general: 'I try to undermine any documentary authority it may possess as a medium.' \nIt does confuse: narratives without authority. We may get lost or put our trust in the titles the artist has given her images. Some of them like Clowns & Jokers\n and The Harrowing Adventures of.. appear rooted in the exercise of bringing Barbie dolls to reality, but now reflect behaviour of perfectly normal people, who may prefer to live within their borders.

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Dr. Khalid al-Jader (1922 - 1988) was a highly active participant in the Iraqi modern art movement. He held several prominent positions and memberships in art institutions and organizations throughout his distinguished career. Al-Jader's work is known for its rural landscapes and village vistas rendered in sweeping brushstrokes. He was attracted to Impressionism and his pieces exhibit many of its aesthetic devices. However, his exploration of style and subject matter transcended these aesthetic similarities to produce what the Palestinian writer, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, calls a distinct Iraqi nature.\nA gifted student, Al-Jader studied at the College of Law\n and the Institute of Fine Art\n concurrently, graduating in 1946 with degrees in art and law. He then travelled to Paris on scholarship to study at the Ècole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts\n in 1954 and earned a Ph.D. in the History of Islamic Art\n from the Sorbonne. While in Paris, Al-Jader joined the Salon de Paris.  \nUpon returning to Baghdad, Al-Jader accepted the deanship at the Institute of Fine Arts\n where he stayed for several years. In 1962 under the supervision of the president of Baghdad University\n , he founded the Academy of Fine Arts\n along with his colleagues Dr. Aziz Shalal Aziz and Dr. As'ad Abdul Razak, and later worked as its dean. Through these administrative activities, Al-Jader demonstrated his engagement in the development of an institutionalized form of art education in Iraq. Concurrent with his academic positions, Al-Jader served as chair of the National Committee\n for Plastic Art\n with UNESCO\n .\nAl-Jader was equally dedicated to his own artistic practice. His style throughout is so consistent that taken together they amount to a vision of Iraq. His loose, rough brushstrokes are accentuated by his use of contrasted, vibrant colors. Al-Jader's markets, streets, and villages are rendered with frenzied daubs of thick paint, making the canvas pulsate with latent energy. The human figures that populate his scenes are part of this rhythm as they conduct their daily lives. Their vitality merely adds to an already dynamic landscape. Although this dynamism was ever-present in Al-Jader's work, it reached a fever pitch in his later paintings with his scenes almost completely abstracted by conflicting strokes of the paintbrush. The seeming chaos of Al-Jader's canvases belies an underlying organization that hints at the precision with which the artist executed his canvases. Each color swath is deliberate in application and each figure is carefully placed to create an expert composition.\nAl-Jader participated in many important artists' societies, including the Pioneers, the Impressionists, and the Society of Iraqi Plastic\n Artists. He also spent time as the head of the Society of Iraqi Artists\n . The painter was also a prolific exhibitor participating in several group exhibitions all over the world. These included Al-Wasiti Festival, the first Arab Biennale, and shows in Paris, Cairo, Brussels, Berlin, the United States, India, Poland, and Russia. He also mounted a number of one-man exhibitions in Baghdad (1955, 1957), Berlin (1959), Prague and Bucharest (1960), Denmark (1965), and Saudi Arabia (1968). Thus his work was both domestically and internationally visible.   \nAl-Jader is valued as a meticulous painter. He also demonstrated this thoroughness in his administrative duties. He was known to have held his students and faculty to a very high standard, a standard that he no doubt applied to himself. His work can be appreciated today at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha and the Jordan National\n Gallery of Fine Arts\n in Amman.\n   "

Through mutual contemplative observation, she strives to blur what is to be understood as a barrier in inter-human relationships.\nLeila Pazooki was born in 1977 in Teheran, Iran and studied painting at the National Art Academy\n in Tehran after the revolution. She then went to study in Munich at the Academy of Fine Arts\n and decided to remain for some time in Mexico.

She does so without talking and without the help of preachers or diplomats. She simply uses mathematics, Islamic mathematics and mathematics which were there already, to recalculate the essential words of creation. 'She calls it The Language of Existence,' somebody wrote, so it is, if she did so. Its alphabet exists of the 99 most beautiful names of Allah, which Al-Homoud is 'deconstructing and recallibrating' into patterns reminicent of Islamic geometry. The new patterns interestingly include, from the moment of the first human cell devision, all brothers born before and after Abraham. So we see, believe and calculate her work.\nThe way in which the artist works, from an understanding that Arabic letters have proportions which represent mathematical codes, is to use these codes to deconstruct or break letters into simpler lines as building material for new geometrical designs. For the computation of the break Al-Homoud went looking for codes by writing on ancient 'Vedic squares' from North India. Such squares contain a multiplication system, which she altered to fit better the growth and development of humanity. She changed the numerical progression of 1 to 9 in the square's first row and column to a progression of 1,2,4,6,8,16,32,64 etc in reference to human cells which multiply and grow by devision, as often religions do too. The Vedic square then needs mergers, because like humans it allows no more than one digit in its own cells. So 16 becomes 7, 32 becomes 5 and 64 becomes 10 and then 1. Just one. Try this yourself: numbering 64 religions and then recomputating them into 1. And if you skip the math but employ preachers and diplomats, then you understand why there is art. If just to think of an idea and not immediately abandon it.\nThe end result of The Language of Existence is a computer generated geometrical design, which was recallibrated from the deconstructed words and silkscreen printed on paper (editions of 20, 118,8 x 89,8 cm). By the end of 2008 the artist could show around 14 finished names of the most beautiful 99 ones. \nComing from the very different visual tradition of calligraphy Al-Homoud's art is similar in it's basic act to what Mondrian or Malevich have done with their western figurative world. Her recallibrated The Last would survive well in the company of Malevich's ultimate vision Black Square.\nAl-Homoud is from Riyadh, where she majored in sociology at King Saud University\n, and was the first Saudi to complete a MA at Central St Martins College of Art\n and Design in London. She has had lessons in calligraphy from Rashid Butt and was inspired by Ahmed Moustafa to learn about a 10th century theoretical system of calligraphy. In 2006 she participated in a British Museum\n managed project to have Arab artists work in schools. She spent six weeks at a school in London 'Exploring Calligraphy and Arab design.' She has participated in and co-curated the 2008 Edge of Arabia\n exhibition in SOAS Brunei Gallery. Her work was chosen by Christie's in April 2009 for their Middle East auction in Dubai.\n   "

Sometimes less outspoken, when she combines images of traditional make-up tools with modern MacDonalds advertising.\n'To control both quality and content,' she writes on her website, she built her own darkroom in Riyadh to develop and print her images. They are black and white, but rampant with colour waiting to be seen or just recognized. Sometimes there are limits to what a photogram will show: the ears of Minnie Mouse do not do well in black and white. So we are left with Mickey only.

Really, I wondered: who or what for 25 years made these children not mix rabbits and automobiles with their doodle writing and daydream scratching? It is what we should do: wonder and ask. It is the artist who wants us to. About the school desks which he collected and presented as readymades for the audience to place on a wall. 'ALL WERE HERE,' it read about the desks and note that the exhibition was in Jeddah and not in Mecca. The artist wants dialogue about our memories. He presumes we can do so in a Socratic manner, disagreeing and convincing each other, using points of reference which work for us all. He wants us to explain and argue about traces of our past, which he simply picks up from the floor or out of the school's backyard. In a way he wants us to go back in time as if we were to cut off our hair; and then he will collect it and remind us that we will grow it back again, unable to change its colour or substance. It changes only slowly with the passing of generations. So is there no point in painting it for any future? Actually there is. Dark haired people who paint their hair blond, lure their partner's blond hair genes into changing direction. So I read somewhere in a scientific paper. In the end the dialectic argument aims to convince. But on the rational level, in the educated world, in the world of Mahdi Al-Jeraibi, in the world of Saudi Arabia's first conceptual artist, we should be optimistic about the potential of art to achieve faster results. Convincing in Al Jeraibi's Mecca is possible on, well, a moments notice, simply by listening and allowing yourself to be convinced. Of his art perhaps. Of his sombre Zincographs which are as far removed from golden palms in Dubai hotels as one can possibly imagine. They are of the moon, rather than of the sun - there is no real zinc involved - shining a dark light on the crossing over of religious rituals of pilgrims, superstitions which survive in Mecca and a fear we have of a know known future of using DNA to recreate. The Zincographs are sculptered paintings: large wooden frames in which the artist has fixated hair he has collected of a variaty of people in a thick plate of hot wax. They are reminicent of ancient Egyptian wax portraits to a conceptual mind only. The hair he used he collected both from anonymous pilgrims - beware of Mecca barbers selling clones - and from individuals he knows well and managed to convince. As one of them is said to be his wife, there is a question that arises in the mirror of memories. Will Al Jeraibi, when his wife's hair is eventually used to clone, be the first Pygmalion to have succeed in giving true life himself to a women of his perfect imagination? We should grant her that. The artist himself is the object of imagination too. The Foundation Al Mansouria who has supported him against the dragons of misunderstanding and disinterest has put him forward as a 'model for the quest of the young and serious.' We should grant them that too. (September 30, 2009).\n   "

She is surely, however, the only such artist who can and will say: I am a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not speaking on her own behalf, but informing the world of her private experiences in the general context of being a professionally working woman in Saudi Arabia. She does so with several series of black and white photographs of women she meets dealing with their Saudi heritage and daily life. I am a Mother and I am a Petroleum Engineer are self evident titles in her I am series. Dowayan, being a freelance photographer with an education in information technology, works for an oil company. She is now its creative director. In her series Beyond the veil and The Choice again women pose in front of Dowayan's camera. The choices Dowayan deals with are not mentioned but shown and numbered. The Choice V shows, for example, a woman in traditional dress holding a tennis racket. Or in Choice II, perhaps the most daring in terms of the question it seems to ask, a female hand holds a pen which has just crossed out a word on a page full of repetition.

A The Choice photo of a Saudi woman holding a steering wheel was printed in Dutch magazine Kunstbeeld as an iconic image of the exhibition, providing well for the notions people have in the Netherlands about Saudi Arabia. But, one should also have a look at her close up of feet dancing in Spanish Scenes and admire simply the elegant black and white forms beyond any context of meaning; fingers that fly like swans and do not point to any future. On the future of art in Saudi Arabia however, Dowayan has sound ideas which she expressed in Arab News. She told the paper that there should be more patronage of the arts in the Kingdom itself and not just by a government system of prizes. The country needs homegrown private foundations to sustain the arts and crafts. Says Manal Dowayan, who listens well to King Abdullah.

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      If not the very first, Mohammed Ben Ali Rbati is certainly one of the earliest modern Moroccan painters. He is often referred to as an easel painter, though he eschewed canvas for watercolors on paper.  Much of the history of modern painting in Morocco began with Rbati. Little has been written about him, and much of the information is contextual. It is clear that he received early support by European artists in Tangier, where he was based for most of his life. Many European painters came through Morocco and especially Tangier in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Tangier was, at the time, an international zone, and was therefore a place conducive to international encounters. In 1903, Rbati became the cook for Sir John Lavery, a portrait painter from Ireland, who discovered that Rbati was a talented painter that practiced watercolor painting in his spare time with care and attention to detail. Rbati had his first exhibition at the Goupil Gallery in London in 1916. Although Rbati had no formal arts training, his exposure to painting and the availability of watercolors in Tangier, thanks to the sizeable British population, awakened within him a desire to paint the daily scenes by which he was surrounded. \nRbati's figurative watercolors on paper focus on Tangier, its Kasbah, and its inhabitants. The paintings depict an extensive cross-section of the local population, showing men gathered around musicians or snake charmers, halqas (story-telling circles) in the Kasbah, and people walking through the streets, as well as scenes in cafes, at festivals, and in lavish interiors. Figures are often simplified and demarcated with clear strokes, the folds of djellabas suggested by well-placed lines, highlighting the brightness of the multiple colors. Many of the watercolors feature large groups of men or women, and the focus is often more on the larger scene than on individualizing details. The geometric lines of city walls, mosques, or intricate geometric tiling contrast with the curved and flowing lines of the figures in their traditional dress. In many examples of Rbati's work, the plane of the picture is entirely flat, with no reference to dimensionality, and the paintings sometimes include decorative borders. However, there are also numerous examples of watercolors that go beyond a flat plane in order to document more closely the scenes the artist witnessed. In these, shadows are clearly placed under each figure, showing the artist's experimentation and study into ways of showing light and multi-dimensionality. While often described in terms of the spontaneity of his expression, the varied treatment of the picture plane suggests the artist's interest in deliberately simplifying the forms as part of a style, not as a default. Rbati consistently signed the front of his canvases, always in Arabic.\nRbati is often left out of histories of painting in Morocco, which in general focus more on the latter half of the twentieth century. However, as a 1918 exhibition of easel paintings at the Hotel Excelsior in Casablanca suggests, there were visiting and local artists working in Morocco through the protectorate era (1912 - 1956). There are a few examples of self-taught figurative Moroccan painters whose works have been preserved. Many of these artists captured daily life and locales, including Abdeslam El Fassi Ben Larbi, who painted daily scenes in central Marrakech. Early painting in Morocco is not a well-documented field, but Rbati's place in many national and international collections pays tribute to his important foundational role.\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      In 1953, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat graduated from the Institute of Fine Art\n in Baghdad. He then travelled to Rome to train at the Accademia di Belle Arti, graduating in 1959. While in Italy, he also studied metals at the Instituto di Zaka in Florence, specializing in casting bronze. He subsequently taught sculpture at the Baghdad Institute of Fine Art\n and the College of Architectural Engineering\n at the University of Baghdad\n .\nDuring his career, Hikmat was a prolific creator and exhibitor, and an active participant in the growing Iraqi art scene. He held several solo shows in Rome, San Remo, London, Beirut, and Baghdad. He also participated in most major national exhibitions in Iraq. He was a member of the Society of the Friends\n of Art\n and later the Al-Zawiya group headed by Faiq Hassan. Significantly, Hikmat was also an influential member of the Baghdad Group of Modern Art\n (BGMA). Founded by his teachers and friends, Jewad Selim and Shakir Hassan Al-Said, the BGMA was arguably the most important artist society in modern Iraq and was dedicated to the idea that Iraq's heritage held a preeminent place within its modern art practice.\nHikmat embraced these ideals within his own work, drawing subject matter and stylistic inspiration from medieval Islamic art and literature, as well as from Mesopotamian figuration. A number of his most famous works represent subjects from the well-known collection of Arab folktales, One Thousand and One Nights. One such work is The Fountain of Kahramana that depicts the heroine pouring oil into jars occupied by a number of Ali Baba's forty thieves. Another is the sculptural duet of Scheherazade and Shahrayar (1971). In this representation of the main characters of 1001 Nights, the figures are rendered with robust monumentality and strong, sinuous forms that harken back to Assyrian statuary. \nAlong with his own art production, Hikmat also assisted in major public works initiated by other prominent members of the artistic community. Foremost among them was Jewad Selim's Monument of Freedom for which Hikmat assisted and supervised the casting process in Florence. He also took over the project when Selim died prematurely in 1961. Another project was the much contested Arch of Victory which stood for decades as a symbol of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. Hikmat completed the massive installation when its original sculptor Khalid al-Rahal passed away in 1987. Despite the connection to the Hussein regime, any plans to dismantle the installation are still being hotly debated.\nIn 2003, just before the invasion of Iraq, Hikmat fled to Amman, Jordan where he continued to work. In Amman, the sculptor often played host to prominent musicians, writers, and artists. Although the Jordanian capital provided him with a haven, as it did for many other Iraqi cultural figures, Hikmat always felt a strong pull towards his birthplace, often referring to Baghdad as a beautiful woman. He returned to Baghdad directly after the invasion to find his home much changed. Typical of the cultural destruction sustained in Baghdad was the defacement of Hikmat's prized monument, Scheherazade and Shahrayar, as looters cut off the king's left hand. The sculptor mourned over the destruction of other public sculptures that he had worked so diligently to complete. These were statues that could not be replaced. He also had to come to terms with the disappearance of close to 150 of his own works, representing the breadth of his career, after the Iraqi Museum of Modern Art\n was looted.\nHikmat, acutely aware of his role as a protector of Iraq's cultural past and present, began a campaign to recover art works that had been looted. He founded the Committee for Recovering Iraq's Culture with the aim of buying back works that had surfaced on underground markets. Through these efforts, he was able to recover at least 100 works, including Jewad Selim's Motherhood in 2003. In this, Hikmat became a mobilizing force amongst his students and colleagues in the preservation of Iraq's cultural heritage.\nHis second return to Iraq, in 2010, was at the behest of the mayor of Baghdad who wished to commission the sculptor to complete a series of monuments for the city. Hikmat agreed and began work on four new sculptures to be erected in various sites in Baghdad. This was to be Hikmat's last project, yet the sculptor would not live to see it come to fruition. To the sorrow of many, Mohammad Ghani Hikmat passed away September 12th, 2011 after suffering from kidney failure at the age of 82. His son is overseeing the completion of the monuments that Hikmat began working on before his death.\n   "

A trained musician as well as an artist, Kazem studied painting at the Emirates Fine Arts Society\n, in Sharjah, UAE, attended Al Rayat Music School\n, in Dubai, and recently received his MFA at the University of the Arts\n, Philadelphia, PA. A pioneering conceptual artist, influenced by his close friend and mentor Hassan Sharif, his work touches on current global transformations in the social, political, and natural environments, and explores abstract ideas about the body, movement, space, and the natural elements. Kazem often works on simultaneous projects over extended periods of time, observing the transformations of his surroundings and the effects of time. In his photographic series Photographs with Flags, Kazem photographs himself next to flags in the desert that mark imminent construction projects, the artist’s body and physical presence bearing witness to the social and environmental change about to occur. Similarly, Kazem’s Window series documented the construction of a high-rise building from his window over the course of two years, as it slowly began to block his view and even the sky. Even within his iconic scratch paintings, time, space, and the body are all present. Since 1990 Kazem has been scratching the surface of paper in varying abstract compositions, capturing and incorporating sound, light and movement embodied on the page, which also changes and is dependent on the changing light of its surroundings.‘I am fascinated by collecting and documenting information about seemingly unimportant objects, traces of our present, within a particular environment,’ the artist writes.\nKazem’s exploration of his surroundings involves categorization and measurement of the unquantifiable, extending to his frequent use of GPS as a medium for recording. \nSelected to represent the United Arab Emirates in 2013’s Venice Biennial, the artist presents an immersive video and GPS installation of his ongoing series Directions, in which the viewer stands at the center of a room surrounded by a moving projection of the sea. Curator Reem Fadda describes it as “intended to recreate an immersive experience of what it is to be lost at sea, to what the waters unafraid, to cross the physical barriers and roam the borders of ideas freely.”\n   "

Melehi, along with Belkahia and Mohammed Chebaa, formed the Casablanca group with an exhibition in Rabat in 1966. In addition to a new modernist style in their personal work, the group was also known for a pedagogy that focused on rooting modernism in local visual culture. In 1969, these artists as well as other professors from the Casablanca École des Beaux-Arts\n organized the \"exposition manifeste,\" an outdoor exhibition in Djemaa al-Fna in Marrakech in order to connect to a larger public outside of official exhibition spaces.\nBeyond his painting, the breadth of Melehi's career has been striking, in his teaching, publishing, and policy roles, and as a graphic designer. His poster for the 1966 Rabat exhibition is currently in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art\n in New York. Melehi was an active member of the group associated with the leftist cultural journal Souffles from 1966 to 1969, and designed its original iconic cover. From 1972 to 1977, Melehi was founder and director of the cultural journal Intégral. In 1974, he co-founded and became the director of the publishing house Shoof. In 1978, Melehi and Mohammed Benaïssa co-founded the Al Mohit association and the Cultural Moussem of Asilah, an arts festival known for its outdoor murals that continues to be held every year. Melehi was arts director at the Ministry of Culture\n (1985 - 1992) and Cultural Consultant to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n and Cooperation\n (1999 - 2002) in Morocco. \nMelehi is known as a leading modernist in Morocco. Since the 1960s, he has been elaborating a body of work based around the recurrent motif of waves. The canvases are consistently hard-edged and optic abstractions – the lines are clean, the colors are clearly delineated, and the brushstrokes and movements of the paintbrush are not visible. The waves themselves are often reconfigured, turned vertically to become flames, or cutting across the canvas on an angle. The waves have been linked to the waves on the beaches of Asilah, Melehi's hometown, the gesture of writing Arabic calligraphy, and, in their meditative consistency, to transcendence and prayer. Over time, he has stayed constant to this project, reconfiguring similar elements in his research into color and form, while continually varying small details, orientation, and color combinations, as well as adding other abstract shapes or symbols. He has also re-worked his waves in other media, as in a sculpture in Mexico in 1968 for the International Meeting of Sculptors, in posters and murals, or integrated into architectural projects.\nMelehi has exhibited widely both nationally and internationally. He was part of significant early exhibitions of Moroccan modernism, including the second Alexandria Biennale (1958), the first and second editions of the Biennale des Jeunes in Paris (1959, 1961), and the Festival of Negro Arts\n in Dakar (1966). He was also involved in significant pan-Arab exhibitions including the Al-Wassiti Festival in Baghdad (1972) and the PLO\n \"International Art\n Exhibition for Palestine\" (1978). He has had numerous solo exhibitions including those at the national gallery, Galerie Bab Rouah, in Rabat (1965, 1997), the Bronx Museum\n in New York, and a retrospective at the Institut du Monde Arabe\n in Paris, as well as at Galerie L'Atelier (Rabat) and the Sultan Gallery\n in Kuwait. He was a guest of honor at the 3rd Sharjah Biennale in 1997 in the UAE.\n   "

At the latter institution, Durra formed a formative friendship with the Italian violinist and self-taught painter Armando Pron. The comradery was influential to Durra's understanding of the connection between music and visual abstraction, a formal relationship often noted by his international and local critics.\nMohanna Durra's artistic achievements have been recognized by numerous prestigious awards, including the following: the first State Appreciation Award for contributions to cultural developments in Jordan (1977); the Gold Medal of Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage\n (1978); and the Golden Pioneer Medal and Appreciation Award of the Union of Arab Artists\n (1980).

A practicing artist since the 1970s, Hatoum works with a wide and often unexpected range of materials and mediums to explore issues that often have conflict at their core. Political, emotional and even aesthetic conflicts are summoned up by Hatoum’s uncanny transformations of the materials and objects of daily life.\nThis is seen in work such as Marble Slicer, a giant egg slicer with a human sized bowl exquisitely rendered in white marble and steel (2002), Cage-a-deux, an oversized birdcage for human occupation (2002) and her more recent work Nature morte aux grenades, where a rolling steel hospital table is covered with colourful and tempting glass ornaments all in the shape of hand grenades (2006-07). Political issues underlie the three map works she has shown in Sharjah. Included in the 8th Biennial\n in 2007 was Hot Spot (2006), a human-scaled steel globe where continents marked in red neon glowed like heated iron, and Projection (2006), a delicately drawn wall map adopting the more accurate ‘Peters’ projection of the world. In Disorientations II, Hatoum recreated her haunting 1996 work Present Tense, in which the cantonized pockets of Palestinian territory that emerged from the map of the 1993 Oslo Accords are represented by bars of Nablus soap. \nOne of the most internationally recognised of artists from the Middle East, Mona Hatoum studied at the Byam Shaw School of Art\n, London (1975-79) and the Slade School of Art\n, London (1979-1981).

The galleries on his website show a variety of approaches to the art of catching our eye, that the artist used over changing periods of time. In the first gallery are images of his early works which were made before 1999 when he was endeavouring to paint reality. Then his second gallery (1999-2001) is more interesting. While some Saudi artists seem to make this conscious decision to paint in an abstract style, it is evident from his work that Haider went to the Jeddah coastline and bathed his eyes in the chaotic behavior of waves that meet the shore. From this his painting may have turned to abstraction by a longing to join the swim. Great painters like William Turner would have given a nod of approval. But this avenue Haider did not pursue for long. In 2002 he turned into the desert with a style of slight abstraction with references to Saudi traditions and religion. What abstraction is there in an Arab horseguard, but for speed and what more abstraction is needed than the truth in an image of Kaaba? After 2005 Haider leaves this style again and comes up with a range of experiments. But he keeps with him his deconstruction of a traditional ornament. Have a look at the journey of the triangles in his paintings and how the black ones keep their distance and stick together. \nSource:\n      \n\n      © All rights reserved.\n   "

Of his many series, those for which he is best known are his thickly encrusted starfish and fractal paintings, built up by layer upon layer of acrylic paint mixed with pumice and finished in vivid colours, and his landscapes, which are expressive portraits of cedars, olive trees and palms, which reconnect him to the places of his childhood, Lebanon and Egypt.\nNabil Nahas was born in 1949 in Beirut and lived the first 10 years of his life in Cairo.  He completed a BFA from Louisiana State University\n at Baton Rouge\n in 1971 and then an MFA from Yale University\n in 1973.

Despite this new direction the central themes of the artist’s work remain.

From the kitsch wrapping paper used as the background in her Wrap Me Up in You Series, to the complex bands of repetitive, brightly coloured shapes occupying the minute 1 mm x 1 mm squares of graph paper in her Home and Carpet series, she uses pattern in its many varying forms as both literal and abstract manifestations of the influence of environment and tradition.\nThe artist grew up in a traditional household and studied Ancient Persian at the Neyshabour Institute\n and Fine\n Art\n at Tehran University\n .

Earning a Bachelor’s degree in art from Tehran University of Fine Arts\n before relocating to the United States in the late 1960s, Nodjoumi received his Master’s degree in Fine Arts\n from The City College of New York\n in 1974. Returning to Tehran to join the faculty of his alma mater, Nodjoumi joined his politically galvanized students in their criticism of the Shah’s regime, designing political posters inspired by the revolutionary spirit sweeping the country, only to be exiled once more in the aftermath of the revolution. This political engagement has continued to the present day. His nuanced figurative paintings engage in political discourse with a light, satirical touch, layering his personal heritage and lived experiences in Iran and the United States into scenes that resonate beyond specific historical contexts or geographical boundaries.\nNodjoumi’s works are conceived of as theatrical stages, where compositions of figures both serious and ridiculous, in the words of Phong Bui, “house meanings without irony, narratives without stories, humor without morality, above all creating a space that heightens the awareness of old and new history.” Serious in subject matter and witty in execution, these rich and diverse characters enliven Nodjoumi’s narratives and allude to collective experiences underpinned by socio-political struggles, articulating the full spectrum of feelings from aggression to victimhood. Nicky Nodjoumi's works are in several prominent collections worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art\n in New York, the British Museum\n in London, the Depaul Art Museum\n in Chicago, and the National Museum of Cuba\n . In 2014, his work The Accident was featured in a solo exhibition at the Cleveland Institute of Art\n . In conjunction with his solo exhibition at Taymour Grahne Gallery in September 2013, his work was also part of Iran Modern, which opened at the Asia Society\n in New York.

Yalter  has lived in Paris since 1965. She participated in the French counter culture and revolutionary political movement of the late 1960s, immersing herself in the debate around gender, migrant workers from Turkey, and other issues of the time.  She also experimented in different media including drawing, photography, video, and performance art.  She was a member of Fighting Women\n, a group of women artists who were active from 1976 to 1980.  Her earliest feminist work, A Nomad’s Tent, a Study of Private, Public, and Feminine Spaces dates from 1973. The Headless Woman or the Belly Dance, 1974,is a classic of early feminist art.   In 1978, she mounted a performance and installation acting out everyday life in a harem using a few pieces of furniture and utensils as part of  A Day of Actions, held in the studio of one of the other members of the collectif.

The scene centers around an itinerant underwear seller touting her wares to the women, who respond with varying degrees of interest.

Having been trained in calligraphy, she finds the relation between words and forms, natural or non-objective, deeply intertwined. In Pouran's recent work, viewers will appreciate her increasingly detailed focus on the form of language as subject matter.\nPouran’s work often employs a mixture of calligraphy and abstract expressionism that intertwines Islamic geometry, Iranian traditions and contemporary aesthetics, with a unique lyricism. Pouran's early paintings were large scale and heavily layered abstractions, whose flowing lines of saturated color and rolling waves of calligraphy brought to life the form as well as the content of the text to which she was responding. With successive series, Pouran narrowed her focus to single words, repeated over and over to create the very object they signified, or aesthetics distilled from a single letter, emphasizing the building block of language and thought.\nThe artist's works are represented in prominent institutional collections such as The Metropolitan Museum\n, New York; Pratt Institute\n, New York; The Museum of Fine Arts Houston\n; Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art\n, NY; Brooklyn Museum\n, NY; Arthur M.

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Rachid Koraïchi began his studies at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Algeria before moving to France, where he continued his studies at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, the Institut d'Urbanisme, and the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Koraïchi's influences come from North Africa and France, although he is interested in ideas of shared prehistoric inheritance, and the ways in which the language of art can be universal and carry a global outlook. While Koraïchi is deeply tied to mystic and visual traditions and draws from the spiritual and artisinal heritage of the Maghreb, in his artwork these ideas and systems of communication are reworked to become part of a new artistic project.\nKoraïchi comes from a Sufi family from Algeria, and his art is often framed within a tradition of Sufi spirituality in which aesthetics and metaphysics are intertwined. Writing and signs, for Koraïchi, hold sacred importance, and calligraphy is often a significant backbone of his work. Drawing from Arabic calligraphy, Koraïchi has created in some ways his own script or graphic language that includes Amazighi and Tuareg letters and mystical symbols. This calligraphy is sometimes legible but often is abstracted with thick repetitions, becoming signs or figures. He has had a long-standing interest in the Sufi poet and scholar Rumi, whose work inspired multiple installations of Koraïchi's long-term project \"The Path of Roses\" (Le Chemin de Roses). His work ranges from mystical, abstract works to direct political commentary in dialogue with revolutionary and liberation movements, as in a number of works supporting Palestine and the Palestinian people. Koraïchi's diverse oeuvre encompasses a wide range of artistic expression, from intimate prints to large-scale banners and installations. He works in varied media, including printmaking, paint, ceramics, and textiles.\nBeyond Koraïchi's personal work, collaborations with writers and poets have been an important part of his oeuvre, as with Mohammed Dib, Jamel Eddine Bencheikh, René Char, Michel Butor. He notably collaborated with Mahmoud Darwish on the large scale project of poems and etchings A Nation in Exile (1981). A number of Koraïchi's works have also been executed in collaboration with North African artisans trained in traditional techniques, as in dyeing, weaving, or pottery. This collaborative work can be seen in the date-palm plantation in the Algerian Sahara that Koraïchi has been developing since 2011. This plantation, conceived of as a kind of large-scale land art, will be ecologically sustainable and devoted to regional culture.​\nKoraïchi has exhibited widely internationally, for instance at the 47th and 49th Venice Biennales (1997 and 2001), \"Global Conceptualism\" (The Queens Museum of Art\n, New York, 1999), \"The Short Century\" (Munich, Berlin, Chicago, and New York, 2001-2), \"Word Into Art\n\" (The British Museum\n, London, 2006), and \"The Future of Tradition – The Tradition of Future\" (Haus der Kunst, Munich, 2010). He has had a number of solo shows, such as the Emirates Palace Auditorium (Abu Dhabi Festival, Abu Dhabi, 2011), the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art\n at Cornell Unversity (Ithaca, New York), Chapelle Saint Martin, Le Mejan (Arles), La Citadelle (Algiers), and Darat al Funun (Amman)\n . He also created a stained-glass window for the Chapelle Sainte-Cécile (Ceillac, France), and has provided illustrations for a number of publications by writers such as Mahmoud Darwish and Rumi. In 2011, Koraïchi won the Victoria & Albert Museum\n 's Jameel Prize, an international prize for contemporary artists inspired by Islamic traditions of craft and design.  Koraïchi's work is held in a number of major public collections, including the British Museum (London)\n, the National Museum\n for African Art\n (Washington, D.C.), the Musée d'art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (Paris), and Darat al Funun\n /The Khalid Shoman Foundation (Amman)\n.\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Ragheb Ayad was born in 1892 into a Coptic\n family in the neighborhood of Faggala in Cairo. He received his primary education at the École des Frères before joining the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo, the year of its creation by Prince Youssef Kamal in 1908. He was among the first students of this new institution along with artists Mahmoud Mokhtar (1891 - 1934), Youssef Kamel (1891 - 1971), Antoine Haggar (1896 - 1962) and Mohammed Hassan (1892 - 1961). After he graduated in 1911, Ayad worked as a drawing teacher at the Coptic Secondary School\n in Cairo and made several trips to France and Italy. Between 1921 and 1922, Ayad and his friend, the painter Youssef Kamel, agreed on an exchange; in turns each would work as a teacher for one year to finance the other's stay in Italy. In 1925, both Ayad and Kamel received a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy\n of Fine Arts\n in Rome along with their colleague Mohammed Hassan. During that time, Ayad traveled around Italy and visited the cities of Florence, Sienna and Venice where he attended the fifteenth Biennale in 1926. After obtaining his diploma from the Decoration department\n of the Royal Academy\n of Fine Arts\n in Rome in 1928, he returned to Egypt the following year.\nAyad was the first to propose the idea of creating an Egyptian Academy\n in Rome on the model of the other foreign academies established in the Italian capital. In 1930, He was appointed as the head of the Decoration department\n at the School of Applied Arts\n in Giza where he remained until 1937. Following this appointment, he became professor and director of the Free section of the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo that offered evening classes to students who had to work during the day. In 1936, he married the Italian painter Emma Caly (-Ayad), with whom he held several exhibitions in Egypt. Ayad also worked as a curator and played an important role in reorganizing the Coptic\n museum in 1941. From 1950 to 1955, succeeding Youssef Kamel, he was named director of the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art\n \t. During his tenure there, he created a special section in the Museum dedicated to the work of the sculptor Mahmoud Mokhtar, which was inaugurated in 1952.\nRagheb Ayad is one of the leading painters of a generation of Egyptian artists commonly referred to as the pioneers (al-ruwwād), as they were the first to be educated in artistic institutions established according to European models, such as the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo. Ayad broke away from his academic education at the Fine Arts\n in Cairo and in Rome to create an original folklorist style that distinguishes him from his contemporaries. Throughout his career, he depicted scenes of rural and popular daily life, such as the market place, the labor in the fields and the popular café, as well as traditional practices rooted in Egyptian culture, such as the zār, a Nubian ritual trance dance, or the taḥtīb, an ancestral game of stick fighting practiced in Upper Egypt. He also painted religious scenes and exterior views of the Coptic\n monasteries.\nAyad mastered the art of sketching and besides his oil paintings, he produced numerous sketches and drawings enhanced with watercolors such as gouache. His expressive style is characterized by the vivacity of his textured strokes that express the dynamic of constant movement, as well as by the use of powerful colors. His work is profoundly marked by the arts of Ancient Egypt: the formal aesthetic of the decorative bas-reliefs and paintings of the tombs and temples of Thebes inspired him to reinvent the ancient system of superposed narrative scenes, which sometimes led him to use horizontal formats. Towards the end of his career, his style progressively evolved towards a purification of lines and stylization of forms. Ayad was also a skilled decorator and painted several interiors of public and private buildings. In 1935, he executed a series of decorative paintings for the old Shepherd Hotel\n that was unfortunately destroyed in the Cairo fire in 1952. He also participated in the interior decoration of religious buildings such as the Coptic Cathedral of Sohag\n and the Catholic\n Churches of Minia and Samalut.\nFrom the 1930's, Ragheb Ayad exhibited regularly at the Salon in Cairo founded by the Society of Fine Art\n Lovers. During his lifetime, he held numerous solo and collective exhibitions in Egypt and abroad. His works are exposed at the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art\n , the Agricultural Museum\n in Cairo, the Museum of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria and at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha.\n   "

The result is a series of tightly controlled compositions, where impeccably applied colorful hard-edge lines are coated in a thick layer of glossy resin, to create seductively tactile reflective surfaces. Rana's works were an exercise in rhythm and symmetry and much like music, had a spiritual quality to them that embraces the heart and gratifies the eye.\nIn more recent work, Rana's works draw inspiration from urban visual stimuli such as the abstract clashes of form and colour that can be seen in the city, and combines them with the traditional repetition of geometric form found in Islamic art. To view the work one is required to adjust their position for the work to unravel. As you move, the work reveals a constant shifting symmetry of colour that ripples, brakes, and reforms before your eyes. It is in this visual movement that Rana creates a compelling visual language where by with the tiniest of movements the surrounding chaos aligns itself into a moment of symmetry. \nRana currently lives and works in London, UK.\n   "

In 1964 Araeen moved to London, and became an early pioneer and practitioner of Minimalism. With no formal training in sculpture, it was his work as a civil engineer and an early encounter with the sculptures of Anthony Caro that influenced the formal language and use of simple or industrial materials characteristic of Araeen’s best-known works.\nYet unlike Caro, Araeen tried to eliminate hierarchy and traditional notions of composition in his work. In early works, such as Sculpture No. 1, conceived in 1968, steel girders were placed, without a plinth, in a simple grid on the gallery floor. In his later ‘Structures’, he used modular cubes or rectangles that were infinitely repeatable and re-combinable. While reflective of Minimalist aesthetics, Araeen’s work became increasingly participatory as seen in works such a Char Yar (1968) where viewers were free to manipulate a series of cubic forms. By 1970, his growing interest in the performative and participatory possibilities of sculpture was realised with his seminal ‘Chakras’ where the artist and audience tossed a series of disks into the water at St. Katherine’s Docks.\nAfter this time, Araeen’s practice became increasingly politicised. As an activist, Araeen was involved in various groups supporting liberation struggles, democracy and human rights in Britain and around the world. In 1978, Araeen founded the critical journals Black Phoenix, Third Text and Third Text Africa. These were groundbreaking platforms for the views and ideas of non-Western artists whose works had been largely ignored or marginalised by traditional art institutions and the art establishment. The publications provided a crucial channel for the exchange of ideas among these artists by linking them together as part of a wider collective within the Black diaspora and Black nationalist movement that was prevalent at the time.\nIn the late 1980s Araeen also became known for his work curating influential exhibitions such as The Essential Black Art at the Chisenhale Gallery\n, London (1987) and The Other Story at the Hayward Gallery\n, London (1989). These exhibitions explored Britain’s colonial and post-colonial past and the legacy of racism, inequality and cultural insensitivity that Araeen felt pervaded British life.\nAraeen has exhibited internationally and regionally with significant solo exhibitions including Zero to Infinity, Museo de Arte, Lima, Peru (2013), Before and After Minimalism: Drawings, Painting, Sculpture and Concepts, 1959 - 1974, Aicon Gallery\n, London (2010), To Whom It May Concern, Serpentine Gallery\n, London (1996), V Habana Biennale\n, Havana, Cuba (1994), Strife and/or Structure, Modern Art Gallery\n, Fukukoa Art Museum\n, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan (1993) and From Modernism to Postmodernism: Rasheed Araeen A Retrospective‭, ‬Ikon Gallery\n, Birmingham (1987).\nHis work has been shown in group exhibitions including the Shanghai Biennale\n, Shanghai, China (2012), Gwangju Biennale\n, Gwangju\n, South Korea (2012), Migrations at Tate Britain, London (2012), The Mediterranean Project\n, Thessaloniki Biennale\n, Thessaloniki, Greece (2011), Live in Your Head, Museu do Chiado, Lisbon, Portugal (2001), every day Sydney Biennale\n, Australia (1998), 2nd Johannesburg Biennale\n in South Africa (1997), Magicians de la terra, Centre George Pompifou/La Villetter, France, Paris (1989) and Art of Society at Whitechapel Art Gallery\n , London (1978).\nAraeen is the recipient of honorary doctorates from Southampton University\n, East London University\n and Wolverhampton University\n .\nThe author of numerous essays and journals Araeen has written Art beyond Art/Ecoaesthetics: A Manifesto for the 21st Century, Third Text Publications, London (2010) and the autobiographical Making Myself Visible, Kala Press\n (1984).\nHis work is included in the collections of the Arts Council of England\n, CANAL PLUS, Paris, Fukuoka Art Museum\n, Fukuok- Shi, Japan and Tate Gallery\n London.\n   "

This book will be a record for the new generation,' is how Binzagr introduces Saudi Arabia, an artist's view of the past (1979). She then writes: 'I don't think that I can live without painting.' She may never have tried. The many colour illustrations of her oil paintings, watercolours, pastels, drawings and etchings are grouped around the themes: marriage, traditional dress, old architecture, religion, daily life and desert life. Illustrated here from the book is a ceremony in which a groom is shaved while his mother places a gold coin on the barber's forehead and wedding musicians entertain him. A scene from the religion chapter, which the artist will not have witnessed herself, is named Al-Mahmal after a decorated camel litter which was used to ceremoniously carry the Kaaba covering for the Hajj into Mecca. The covering used to be presented by Egypt and arrived by ship through the Suez canal accompanied by a 'Prince of the Hajj,' she writes. Binzagr may have used old photographs to reconstruct this scene as she is reported to have spent much effort to research and collect photographic material from such collections as the Royal Geographic Society\n in London. She also uses her family as a source and sometimes as a model as she did with her sister for her trademark picture Zabun. The'Safeya's Mona Lisa' is a portrait of a Saudi lady in a traditional and unvieled dress that was still common in the 1960's in the western province of Hijaz.\nBinzagr was born to a well known merchant family in Jiddah and attended school in Sussex, England. In the mid 1960's she started her career as a professional artist with a program of full time art studies in Cairo. \nSource:\nSafeya Binzagr, Saudi Arabia, an artist's view of the past, Jiddah and Lausanne 1979.\n      \n\n      © All rights reserved\n   "

She learnt to draw and paint under the tutelage of Omar Onsi and Moustafa Farroukh, prominent Lebanese artists who adopted impressionist and realist styles. A trip to Egypt in 1943 sparked her passion for Islamic art and architecture and her conviction – despite the beliefs of her tutors – that Arab artists ‘reached into the essence of the subject, stripping it of all the associated with art since the time of the Greeks until the end of the 19th century.’/nAt the end of the 1940s Choucair spent three important years in Paris where she absorbed the current themes, trends and philosophies of European modernism. Though she was a student at the École des Beaux-Arts\n and attended the studio of the master Fernand Léger, Choucair found like-minded individuals at the Atelier d’Art Abstrait\n , a group of artists committed to the pursuit of abstract or non-objective art. The exhibition at Tate Modern\n begins with a group of vibrant gouache paintings from this period, showing the artist’s experiments with repeated, modular forms inspired by her love of geometry and mathematics.\nSaloua Raouda Choucair Infinite Structure 1963-5/nSaloua Raouda Choucair\nInfinite Structure 1963–5/n© Saloua Raouda Choucair Foundation\n/nIn the late 1950s, working from her home studio in Beirut, Choucair began modelling in clay and carving wood. Her first series of sculptures explores the trajectory of a line. Choucair was interested in the ability of a line to follow a path that allows it to transform itself into numerous shapes. The line and curve are basic elements of the visual language that she used throughout her career, finding its way into a variety of media including painting, sculpture, textiles, murals and other domestic designs./nIn the 1960s she worked on a series known as ‘interforms’; simple cubes or blocks housing intricately carved, complex internal forms. This was followed by the series she later titled ‘poems’, modular sculptures with parts that stack together in a flexible way. Each module, like the stanzas of Arabic poetry, may stand alone or be stacked with others to be read as a whole. A further group of works are known as the ‘duals’, having two interlocking parts./nChoucair’s ideas are often worked out across various materials, and forms from her early paintings are repeated in later sculptures and in other items she made to express her belief that art should be a living, architectural reality. The exhibition brings groups of these works together, showing the rich and complex connections between pieces and exploring the artist’s belief in the power of non-objective art. An extensive display of small maquettes that Choucair made throughout her career shows fascinating ‘studies’ that reveal the artist’s impressive creative energy. One of her modular paintings from the late 1940s was pierced by shards of shattered glass in the artist’s apartment during a bombing raid in the Lebanese civil war of the 1980s. The object bears witness to that history and the circumstances through which Choucair not only survived, but continued to work with energy and enthusiasm./nThe final room showcases a group of experimental sculptures from the 1980s made of aluminium, plexiglass and nylon thread that relate to Choucair’s ambitions to incorporate water and movement into her works./nThroughout the 1980s and 90s Choucair received increasing recognition and awards for her work. In 1982 she was commissioned by the Lebanese Lions Club\n to create a major public sculpture. The piece was installed at the southern entrance to Beirut, but was vandalised and then disappeared completely. Choucair went on to complete further commissions in the 1990s, one of which now stands at the Gibran Khalil Gibran Garden in downtown Beirut./nIn 2011 a major retrospective of her work was held at the Beirut Exhibition Center\n . Choucair is now in her 96th year and her daughter is working on the establishment of her Foundation. The curators of the exhibition, Jessica Morgan and Ann Coxon, were given access to Choucair’s archive and the substantial body of work that remains in her Beirut apartment. This is the first opportunity to see a broad and fascinating selection of works by Saloua Raouda Choucair finally taking their place in a museum of international modern art.\n   "

Most of her paintings are of women with no facial features. They quote the artist: “This is not because we don’t have a right to speak, or that we don’t see enough. It is just going abstract, and the faceless ladies started with the religious restriction on figurative representation and the prohibition of that in Islam. I am not really sure about this; I do portraits, but when I do full figures, I have to miss something out, so it is not complete. I like them being faceless because once I put a face to that, it becomes someone, and I am not talking about someone – I am talking generally about women.\"\nIn the 3rd Saudiaat Art Group\n exhibition in 2008 criteria for participation were introduced among which is the Saudi nationality.

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Mohammed Seif al-Din Wanly was born into an aristocratic family of Turkish origin on his father's side, Ismaïl Bey Mohammed Wanly, and of Caucasian origin from his mother, Ismat Hanem al-Daghistani. He grew up with his four sisters and his younger brother, Adham\n, in an intellectual francophone environment. They were educated by private tutors in their family house, the Urfan Pacha\n Palace located in the neighborhood of Muharram Bey in Alexandria. Seif worked as a public official at the customs archives of Alexandria and started painting with his brother, Adham\n . In 1929, Ottorino Bicchi (1878 - 1949), an Italian painter from Livorno, opened a studio in Alexandria and the Wanly brothers were among his first students. After Bicchi left Egypt in 1934, Seif and Adham established their own studio in Alexandria the following year together with their friends, the painter Ahmad Fahmi and the filmmaker Mohammed Bayoumi.\nDuring the 1950's, the two brothers traveled regularly to Europe and visited France, Italy and Spain where they sketched and painted numerous scenes of ballet, opera and theater performances, as well as landscapes. When sculptor Ahmad Osman (1907 - 1970) established the Faculty of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria in 1957, Seif was appointed professor within the painting department. In 1959, the Ministry of Culture\n commissioned the Wanly brothers along with many artists of their generation, such as Tahiya Halim and Hussein Bikar, to record the architectural heritage of Nubia before its flooding due to the construction of the High Dam in Aswan. The same year, when his brother Adham\n passed away, Seif lived through a difficult period, which was reflected in his work. At the age of sixty-eight, he married the Egyptian painter Ihsan Mokhtar. He died in 1979 in Stockholm where he was preparing an exhibition of his Scandinavian landscapes.\nThe Wanly brothers were very close in their life and work. They influenced one another and developed a similar style. Seif only used his first name to sign his paintings while his brother, Adham\n, signed them by the name of Wanly or E. Wanly (Edham Wanly). Together, they introduced modern pictorial trends in Alexandria and were among the first to depict international subjects, breaking away from the folklorist style of their contemporaries.\nSeif was a prolific artist who produced more than a thousand paintings, as well as numerous drawings and sketches. His early works are inspired by the use of the light and gentle strokes of his Italian professor, Ottorino Bicchi, who was close to the Italian Macchiaioli and the École de Barbizon. Later in his career, Seif used larger surfaces of bold colors and exercised greater freedom in his compositions, both of which brought him closer to Fauvism. \nSeif was fascinated by the performance arts and depicted scenes of circus, ballet, opera, music concerts, bull-fighting as well as all types of sports​, including horse races. He represented the life of the performers on stage and backstage by expressing their vivid and dynamic movements. His fascination with performance arts also led him to design several sets for theater and opera productions in Egypt. He painted numerous views of traditional Nubian villages before they were flooded, as well as many landscapes of Egypt and all the countries he visited, including Spain, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Poland and Russia. Seif is also the author of a series of self-portraits that reflect his sense of humor and derision. Following the death of his brother, Adham\n, which affected him profoundly, he introduced a darker palette of colors and shades in his paintings. His works can be seen at the Seif and Adham Wanly Museum\n hosted in the villa of the Mahmoud Saïd Museum\n in Alexandria, the Museum of Fine Arts\n in Alexandria, the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art in Cairo, the Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha, as well as in numerous private collections around the world.\n   "

If ever there is need to imagine a hunchback on the minarets of the Grand Mosque in Makkah many djinns will no doubt summon Shadia and her sister Raja to draw and write his grotesque lines with a single pencil to please both ears and eyes. The artist and her novel writing sister were born in Makkah and later lived in Taif where Shadia as a child is said to have drawn on the doors. By the time she lived in Paris Alem had managed to move up to painting landscapes on the tail fin of some British Airways\n aircraft.\nIn Saudi Arabia Shadia Alem has been supported by the Al-Mansouria Foundation\n. It owns a number of her oils on paper of mysterious and traditionally dressed women of the early 1990s. They seem to be part of a series that the artist calls her Wabar collection, apparently in reference to a city of Bedouin legend, which was destroyed by a destructive wind. Shadia is said to have later turned to landscape painting, before she discovered that the imagination may flow even more freely in less conventional ways. While informing us that Tracy Enim's Bed spoke to her in 1999, she turned to making installations. In the Kunstmuseum Bonn\n in 2004 she joined a show \"Languages of the desert\" of artists from the Gulf region with an installation Negatives: no more, using dvd, photo and negatives. An installation, Powerless, and two series of photographs, named Compassionate wires and Rain, featured in 2007 in Bahrain in a solo presentation at Albareh Art Gallery.\nAt Edge of Arabia\n in 2009 Alem suspended from the ceiling a series of large transparent panels on which in black and white details of the eye was painted much enlarged with her sister's writing dancing lines around the pupil. Jah Eye: meaning the 'beautiful eye.'Last now, but perhaps first for posterity, are the books that Shadia Alem illustrates. Djnniyat Lar is a series of 21 paintings in which the artists wrestles freedom of imagination without leaving the boundaries of anthropomorphism. At the request of Al-Mansouria her sister Raja wrote stories to go with the images of the djinn. For this she must have had assistance from a passing army of these creatures. Raja told us at Edge of Arabia\n that for a month she was without inspiration to write stories and then wrote down 40 of them in half an hour. Although she informed us in the same interview that she tells lies all the time, this may actually be true since such events happen in opposition to what must have passed at the city of Wabar.

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Born in 1926 in Lebanon, Shafic Abboud is one of the foremost Arab artists of the 20th century. His paintings are a manifesto for freedom, colour, light and joy, as well as being a permanent bridge between the art scenes of France and Lebanon and that of Europe and the Middle East. Both Lebanese and Parisian, he was very attached to Lebanon, to its landscapes, its light and his own childhood memories. He was from a Lebanese Arab Modern culture. The stories of his grandmother, who was the village’s story-teller, left an indelible mark on him, at a very early age. He was familiar with the paintings of the travelling story-tellers. The artist’s eye was also strongly influenced by Byzantine icons and traditions from his church. The writings, debates, ideals, hopes and battles characterising the Arab Nahda, a modernist and anti-clerical Renaissance which was initially driven by Arab and Lebanese writers, were to later have a significant impact on Abboud’s intellectual education.\nShafic Abboud arrived in 1947 in Paris. He blended in perfectly with the city’s artistic life, just as many other artists who had come from all over the world after the Second World War (from North and South America, Europe, Asia and North Africa). This was the second major movement of migration to Paris. France’s capital was still at the time the City of lights and the favourite destination of upcoming artists seeking for modernity, embodied by Claude Monet’s last painting period and by all the Parisian masters of the 20th century. He had a particular preference for works by Pierre Bonnard, Roger Bissière and Nicolas de Staël. Abboud’s painting gradually moved from the poetic Lebanese figuration towards the lyrical Parisian abstraction, followed by a move from abstraction towards a very subtle and sublime personal “abboudian transfiguration”, which was simultaneously traditional and modern, pagan and sacred.\nHis work is often an invitation to the joy of life, a pagan hedonism yet limited by our frail human condition. However, this does not prevent a tragic element from being present in some of his paintings. These occasionally evoke, in an obvious or subtle way, difficult situations from stages of his life or that of his friends’, the tragic events happening in Lebanon, in the Arab world and in various parts of the World. Although Abboud never overtly put forward his engagements, his oeuvre and his interviews with the Arab press reveal his opinion as well as his political and social concerns.\nWhen I described his mature work as being ‘transfigurative’ earlier on, it seems to me that this word reflects best Abboud’s search for a synthesis between his fairy-tale like childhood world and his technical mastering of abstract Parisian painting. He sought to transcend the latter, stimulated by both Bonnard and de Staël, by giving it a soul of its own and a rich and luminous texture. Through his paintings, Abboud aimed to share his own view on both his inside and outside worlds. He transfigured images filtered from his memory into painting, such as his series of Destroyed Cafés of 1990. These large colourful compositions beam the tragic reality of the war in Lebanon devastating the cafés by the sea in Beirut, which Abboud loved going to on his own or with his friends, when he used to visit every winter until 1975. In a similar way, he also transfigured his memory of his friend Simone after her death, whose dresses fascinated Abboud with their various shimmering fabrics. Being neither a devout follower nor believer of any religion, Abboud was nonetheless very much influenced by the glory of the Byzantine Greco-Arab liturgy. Symbolically, Art triumphs over death.\nPlease allow me to remind you the importance of this artist. Not only the French but also the Lebanese and Arab critics acknowledged the quality of Abboud’s painting at a very early stage in his life. Furthermore, he was the first and only artist from the Arab World to participate to the first Biennale of Paris\n in 1959. In Lebanon, during two decades 1950-1970, he played a major role for Beirut’s cultural and artistic life. Beirut was the beam of all the Near-Eastern countries, and had experienced many fruitful hours of freedom, creativity, prosperity and a particular way of life, which contributed to its international reputation. Up to 1975, Abboud was used to spending the three winter months in Lebanon. He taught at the Lebanese University\n and organised personal exhibitions in one of the best galleries of the capital. Abboud’s works were exhibited alongside the biggest names of the Parisian art scene up to 1968, and he participated to the FIAC\n in Paris, from 1983 onwards. In 1994, after 15 years of war, the show of his oeuvre in Beirut was a huge media and commercial success. When Abboud passed away in April 2004, a moving farewell ceremony was organised at the Parc Montsouris in Paris’ 14th district, very close to where the artist had his small studio. Abboud then received a triumphant welcome, when his body was transferred to Beirut and to Mount Lebanon, where he was buried, as per his wish./n\n   "

His interest lies in singling out particular objects whose images captivate him, and by painting them he releases the feeling of anguish they create.\nPouyan's hooves are symbols for the aspiration of power, lonely beings with vain attempts at grandeur which are faintly ridiculous provoking mixed feelings of pity and contempt.  The works draw their inspiration from Iranian miniatures with references to the cow as the symbol of power in the ancient cultures of Sumer, Babylon, Iran and Hinduism, emphasising the superego of male aggression throughout the centuries.\nPouyan brings the same spirit to his projectiles, demonstrating his wry sense of humour through references to high Persian culture.  Working with traditional armourers and metal-smiths, and taking intricately decorated costume armour and military helmets, he has morphed them into the shape of modern rockets or 'projectiles'.  These suspended sculptures have an unsettling human-like experience closely resembling actors in the 'Taziyeh' (passion play) performed during the month of Muharram.\nBorn in Isfahan, Iran, in 1979, Shahpour Pouyan currently lives and works between New York and Tehran. He recently completed an MFA in Integrated Practices and New Forms at Pratt Institute\n, New York, and has an MFA in Painting from the Tehran University of Art\n.

She uses typography as her medium to explore socio-political themes heavily influenced by her Persian heritage. Her explicative use of the Farsi language and its poetry creates graphic and dynamic imagery, captivating regardless of one’s knowledge of the language or culture. In What Lies Beneath | Second Edition, the artist presents a series of black and white photographs entitled ‘Mountains of Alas and Regret’ and a video work. The mountainscapes, playing with Farsi words by creating landscapes from them, redefine expressions of emotion, literally and metaphorically shrouding them to create an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. Chavangalaee explores the sensation of the sublime, the pleasant pain that feats of nature arouse. She evokes the countless ‘mountains’ that we feel defeated by, or disappointed by if we eventually reach their summit.\nChavangalaee’s video project ‘Artist in Residence’, created during her recent residency in London with Magic of Persia, documents the artist applying eye make-up repeatedly until her eyes are smothered in black.

Fascinated by notions of physical space, her sculptures and installations materialise as simple gestures that emphasise the representation of tension, weight and space.\nAl Mazrou's  group exhibitions include the 1° International Arezzo Biennial of Art\n, Italy (2013); Art Dubai\n (2013); 14th Asian Art\n Biennale, Bangladesh (2010); Sharjah Art Museum\n , UAE and Museum of Modern Art\n , Germany (2010). She has taken part in residency programs at the Delfina Foundation\n, London in collaboration with Tashkeel\n, Dubai Culture and Arts Authority\n, Bastakiya, Dubai.  Throughout 2014/2015 Al Mazrou participated in the ground breaking group exhibition Past Forward, Contemporary Art\n from the Emirates, the first exhibition of Emirati Art\n to tour across the USA. Having premiered in Washington, D.C. in May 2014, the exhibition continued to the Fowler Museum\n in UCLA, Los Angeles from 25 January to 8 March 2015.\nIn 2014 Al Mazrou was one of five international artists commissioned by the Arab Fund\n for Art & Culture\n to produce a public artwork in Dubai as part of their event 'Make Art\n Possible'. The public sculpture entitled Stand Here composed of scaffolding tubes in primary colours was temporarily comissioned for  the Jalila Cultural Centre\n for Children, Dubai.\n   "

So we read on the internet: in Jeddah the apples from France and the oranges from Egypt come in Sharbatli boxes and have Sharbatli stickers on them. It is no surprise then that Shalima Sharbatli informs people that she lives with art 24 hours a day. 'An instinctive Saudi painter,' she herself was branded by Arab News and having to juggle at a young age with a touch of paradise perhaps educated her with knowledge that needs discovery. No images of her artwork travel on the internet, but for the picture in Arab News of herself as an artist, revealing a pair of trousers usually reserved for the atelier, and in front of one of her large outside works in Jeddah. The latest news on her is that she is planning a joint exibition in Paris with two artists from France and Spain. Mitterand Jr. will open the show. It is indeed about finding - not building - bridges, but art is not an international language, as Shalima is quoted to have said in wonder of people who 'imprison' themselves in local subjects. Art needs a viewpoint. The very best artists have eyes at the back of their heads, instinctively. As she is reported to have said that the music made her proud, a closer look at Sharbatli's work will surely reveal some lines of the national anthem of Saudi Arabia. Perhaps the daring scale of her work is such a line and those visiting the government guesthouse in Jeddah, should look out for a 17 meter long wall painting and be the judge of it. The limited glimpse of her work in the Arab News photo reminds me of a Dutch woman of noble birth, Jacoba van Heemskerk, who's more abstract paintings were influenced by Cubism and German expressionism, and who started very much by painting with the brain and struggled to jump out. But that is not Shabatli. It looks like the paint jumped on her first.\nSource:\n      \n\n      26 Augustus 2008:An instinctive Saudi painter by Galal Fakkar.18 September 2008:Art used to build bridges by Galal Fakkar.\n© All rights reserved.\n   "

Throughout his forty-year career, Mansour has established himself as an internationally recognized artist dedicated to giving visual expression to Palestinian identity.\nBorn in 1947 in Birzeit, a Palestinian town north of Ramallah, Mansour studied fine arts at Bezalel Art Academy\n in Jerusalem. Since the seventies, he has contributed to the development of an iconography of the Palestinian struggle through his works on paper. Uniting Mansour's body of work is the depiction of the orange tree (considered to symbolize the 1948 Nakba), the olive tree (considered to symbolize the 1967 war), traditional Palestinian embroidery, village life, and the figure of the Palestinian woman as the mother figure figure of Palestine, giving birth to and protecting the Palestinian people. One of Mansour's most recognized works is the 1974 painting, Camel of Hardship. In this image, the figure of the porter bends under the weight of his satchel, which is significantly shaped like an eye and holds the city of Jerusalem as identified by the Dome\n of the Rock. Personifying Palestine through the figure of an old, weary, and isolated man, Mansour captures the concept of sumud, or steadfastness, and the continuing endurance of the struggle despite hardship. Before its international acclaim, the piece resonated locally as it was printed as posters in 1975 and displayed in homes and public venues throughout the West Bank\n and Gaza.\nIn 1987, together with artists Vera Tamari, Tayseer Barakat, and Nabil Anani, Mansour founded New Visions, a collective formed in response to the first intifada (1987 - 1993). While fostering a revolutionary approach to aesthetics in Palestinian art, the artists also participated in the intifada by boycotting art supplies imported from Israel. Working instead with natural materials such as coffee, henna, and clay, the artists tied the process of art making to both the land and the struggle. This body of work documents an important moment in the history of Palestinian art. Although the artists adopted a nationalist agenda similar to other artists working in the social realist style, the distinction lies in an abstracted composition. Art\n no longer merely represented the political, but instead artistic production itself constituted a political act.\nSince then, Mansour has become acclaimed for a unique body of work that uses mud as a medium. Layering and molding mud into figural compositions on a wooden framework, Mansour deploys the actual land to depict Palestine, its history, and people. Working in a variety of sizes—some pieces are life-size—the artist creates what critics have termed \"emblems of decay,\" as the cracks and distortions of the drying process suggest the passage of time and the impermanence of materiality. In one of his most important series from 1996 entitled, I am Ismail, the artist molds a relief of the biblical figure into what appears as an ancient tombstone. Commemorating Ismail's story of exile and his relation to the land, Mansour suggests through the title his own autobiographical connection to the story of Ismail. The series documents the artist's continued dedication to a set of aesthetic concerns intimately related to the visualization of the Palestinian struggle in all its hardships and aspirations.\nMansour has contributed extensively to the development of an infrastructure for the fine arts in the West Bank\n. He was the head of the League of Palestinian Artists from 1986 to 1990. In 1994, Mansour co-founded al-Wasiti Art Center\n in East Jerusalem and served as Director from 1995 to 1996. He is a member of the Founding Board of Directors\n of the International Academy of Art Palestine\n , established in 2004 in Ramallah. He has taught at numerous cultural institutions and universities throughout the West Bank\n , including Al-Quds University\n . Also a professional cartoonist, Mansour published from 1981 to 1993 in Al-Fajr English Weekly, a Palestinian English weekly formerly published in Jerusalem. He is the co-author of the 1998 publication, Both Sides of Peace: Israeli and Palestinian Political Poster Art\n.\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      Suad al-Attar's is part of a generation of artists who benefited from the educational foundation laid by art educators like Hafidh al-Droubi and Faiq Hassan. As one of Iraq's leading female artists, however, she is also a pioneer in her own right. Al-Attar earned degrees from the Academy of Fine Art\n in Baghdad and California State University\n . She also did graduate work in London, studying printmaking at the Wimbledon School of Art\n and the Central School of Art\n and Design. Following her studies, Al-Attar taught at the University of Baghdad\n . In 1965, the artist held a solo exhibition in Baghdad, becoming the first woman to do so. Her surreal canvases have a uniquely mysterious quality that resonate with Iraq's rich literary past. Al-Attar is counted among the many modern and contemporary Iraqi artists who are committed to preserving the cultural traditions of their homeland.\nSuad al-Attar became actively engaged in the Iraqi art scene in the 1960s. However, her artistic output reached maturity in the 1970s. During this time Iraqi art gained unprecedented international exposure. The government frequently sponsored artists to travel for international art events and foreign artists were invited to participate in domestic art festivals and exhibitions.  Al-Attar played a major role in this outward movement exhibiting extensively in international biennials, where she won a number of awards (specifically at biennials in London in 1978, Cairo in 1984, Brazil in 1985, and Malta in 1995). Al-Attar also participated in the London-based Third World Biennale of Graphic Art\n in 1980 which brought together printmakers from various nations in collective exploration of the media.\nAlthough al-Attar has lived in London since 1976, she has remained faithful to the cultural heritage of her birthplace. She has embraced Iraq's folkloric past drawing inspiration from Arab poetry, history, and mythology. Winged and composite creatures make a regular appearance as subject matter for the artist, recalling Assyrian and Sumerian visual culture. Other common motifs like palm trees, horses, and peacocks are also indicative of Mesopotamian, as well as medieval Islamic, influence. These subjects have since become powerful symbols for Iraq itself. In addition, classical and contemp​orary poetry​ of the region has been a constant source of inspiration for the artist. The ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh for example provided a literary backdrop for al-Attar's visual interpretations of the story's setting and characters. The artist also draws textual parallels in more obvious ways by weaving calligraphic poetry in and around her landscapes and figures.\nHer vision of Iraq's past and present is imbued with fantastical properties. Al-Attar's oeuvre is composed of a kaleidoscope of surreal landscapes, mythical creatures, and epic characters. Even the artist's portraits are infused with a dreamlike quality. The phantasmagoric nature of al-Attar's canvases con​jure imaginative tales of days past and transports the viewer to an otherworldly space. Oftentimes utilizing a monochromatic color scheme, her characters emerge from fantastic landscapes or fading architecture. They gaze out at the viewer, inviting them to participate in an emotive and epic narrative as if the audience is the ultimate interpreter of the enigmatic scene.\nEncouraged by her graphic sensitivity, much of her work is flat, linear, and emblematic. Pattern and ornamentation play a central role in her compositions. It has been suggested that al-Attar developed her style based on Islamic miniatures. Although her canvases can be quite large, this influence can be clearly seen in al-Attar's treatment of plant life, her attention to minute detail, and in her use of decorative patterning. Furthermore, there seems to be an effort towards beautification and novelty of design that is ever-present in both instances.\nAl-Attar's visual interpretations of poetry and folklore are deeply personal and provocative in a way that is distinct and still resonates with viewers. Although al-Attar's oeuvre can and should be viewed within the tradition modern Iraqi inaugurated by the work of such figures as Faiq Hassan and Jewad Selim, her art also contains introspective qualities that hint at an underlying femininity. She has developed a personalized set of symbols that disclose an intimate engagement with her subjects through self-exploration and remembrance. Derived from her childhood memories these symbols include gold for the domes of the city, a fish for the Tigris, and a rooster for life in Baghdad; all reminders of home. Indeed, Al-Attar's blending of dreamscape and reality is transformative leading the viewer to a metaphysical understanding of Iraq's rich cultural heritage. Ultimately, however, this understanding is mediated through the artist​'s private emotive lens.\nAl-Attar's more recent works continue this emotively imaginative quality, yet at the same time also engage more directly with current national realities, exploring and expressing the trauma that Iraq has suffered since the 1990s.\nAl-Attar's work is held in both private and public collections, including many prestigious art institutions like the British Museum\n and the Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha, Qatar. Unfortunately, her work is also featured on the Iraqi National Museum\n of Modern Art\n 's Red List, meaning her work was looted from the museum in the wake of the US-led invasion.\n   "

As long as they remember that when the sky is blue it might not rain.\nTalal is one of those much travelled Saudi's who has set up camp again in Riyadh and it seems that he has rediscovered the austere black-and-white fashion of local wisdom among the many flags of the world. Those flags perhaps, one may agree, advertise no more than biscuits. They are all biscuits (2009) it reads in mirror image in his paint on paper work of similar title.

Between the use of new technologies and the appropriation of techniques resulting from the most local craft, the artist syntheses a context in order to highlight what is related to a specific space/time. Presented on the international scene through several major exhibitions and biennials, such as the Canaries, Pontevedra, Dakar or Singapore Biennials, his work spreads a universal message of intimate and interpersonal communion.\n   "

In 1908, he was among the first students to join the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo together with artists Mahmoud Mokhtar (1891 - 1934), Ragheb Ayad (1892 - 1982), Antoine Haggar (1896 - 1962) and Mohammed Hassan (1892 - 1961). The School was founded the same year by Prince Youssef Kamal. Kamel studied in the painting section under the Italian painter Paolo Forcella. He graduated in 1911 and the same year, and participated in the first exhibition of the students of the School of Fine Arts\n held at the Automobile Club\n in Cairo. In 1912, he was appointed as a drawing teacher in secondary schools. Between 1921 and 1922, Kamel and his friend, the painter Ragheb Ayad agreed on an exchange, according to which each of them would work in turns as a teacher for one year to finance the other's stay in Italy.\nIn 1925, Kamel received a scholarship to pursue his studies at the Royal Academy\n of Fine Arts\n in Rome together with his colleagues, Ragheb Ayad and Mohammed Hassan. He shared a studio with them in Rome and studied under the renowned Italian painter Umberto Coromaldi (1870 - 1948). During that period, he executed several copies of masterpieces in the collection of the Villa Borghese and painted a series of vedute, Italian townscape views, featuring Roman antique and Renaissance monuments, a genre he would later transpose to medieval Cairo. After receiving his diploma from the Royal Academy\n of Fine Arts\n in Rome, Kamel returned to his homeland in 1929 and was appointed professor of painting at the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo. In 1937, he became the head of the painting section when the Alexandrian painter and diplomat, Mohammed Naghi (1888 - 1956), was director of this institution. Kamel also worked as a curator and directed the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art from 1948 to 1949 before he was named director of the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo between 1950 and 1953.\nYoussef Kamel belongs to a generation of Egyptian artists commonly referred to as the pioneers (al-ruwwād), as they were the first to be educated in artistic institutions established according to European models, such as the School of Fine Arts\n in Cairo. Kamel remained faithful to the lessons of his two Italian teachers, Paolo Forcella and Umberto Coromaldi, who were both followers of the Machiaioli movement. They introduced him to the technique of oil painting and the genres of landscape, nudes and portraits, which Kamel adapted to Egyptian subjects. His work expresses a sense of peacefulness and nostalgic timelessness through the use of light strokes and gentle colors. Kamel also portrayed some of his contemporaries and friends with great sincerity, such as the sculptor Mahmoud Mokhtar as well as individuals from the countryside and the working-class neighborhoods of Cairo. His works can be found in private collections, the Museum of Egyptian Modern\n Art in Cairo, the Agricultural Museum\n in Cairo, as well as in the Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art\n in Doha. Unfortunately, on the 20th of July 2012, an important collection of his works was stolen, following a looting in his family villa in the neighborhood of Matariya in northern Cairo where many of his paintings were preserved.\n   "

Born in Egypt in 1972, he grew up in the streets of Cairo where hand-painted cinema posters gave the walls a timeless elegance, whilst classics from a past era shown on television were to inspire his first love of the big screen.\nWhilst studying litterature at the University of Cairo\n in 1992, as a sideline he began producing black and white photographs; highly dramatic scenes inspired by the golden age of Egyptian cinema. Some encounters were to have a very early influence on in his career: for instance with David Lachapelle (1993-1994) and Mario Testino (1997-1998) whom he accompanied as assistant photographer from New York to Paris.\nOn returning to Egypt in 1999, Youssef Nabil decides to put colour into his black and white silver gelatin prints; old-fashioned images produced in the spirit of the great studios, after a dream-like vision shared with his friend Van Leo (Leon Boyadjian, 1921-2002). By using a brush to retouch each one of his portraits, he magnifies the expressions of the models he has immortalised – Egyptian personalities and international celebrities from cinema, music, fashion, art and architecture: from Catherine Deneuve to Omar Sharif, Natacha Atlas to Jean-Paul Gaultier and people like Tracey Emin and Zaha Hadid...\nMoving from one place to the next, the wanderings of Youssef Nabil recounted through his self-portraits mirror his projects, residences and exhibitions which take place all over the world. His works have been shown in many institutions on the International art scene, amongst them : the Villa Medici (Rome), the Venice Biennale (Venice)\n, the Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie (Arles), the Kennedy Centre (Washington)\n, the BALTIC Centre\n for Contemporary Art (Newcastle), the Institut du Monde Arabe (Paris)\n , Savannah College of Art and Design (Savannah)\n , Kunstmuseum (Bonn), the Aperture Foundation (New York)\n the Centre de Cultura Contemporànea de Barcelona (Barcelona), the British Museum (London)\n and the Centro de la Imagen (Mexico). His work on the portrait was rewarded by the Seydou Keita prize in 2003 awarded at the photography Biennale de Bamako (Mali), while two monographs already document his work: Sleep In My Arms (Autograph ABP and Michael Stevenson, 2007) and I Won’t Let You Die (Hatje Cantz, 2008).\n   "

In Detroit’s fertile musical environment, Yusef soon established long-standing friendships with such masters of American music as Milt Jackson, Tommy Flanagan, Barry Harris, Paul Chambers, Donald Byrd, the Jones brothers (Hank, Thad and Elvin), Curtis Fuller, Kenny Burrell, Lucky Thompson and Matthew Rucker. He was already proficient on tenor saxophone while in high school, and at the age of 18 began touring professionally with swing bands led by Hartley Toots, Hot Lips Page, Roy Eldridge, Herbie Fields and eventually Lucky Millender. In 1949 he was invited to join the Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra\n.\nIn 1950 he also converted to Islam in the Ahmadiyya movement and took the name Yusef Lateef. From 1955–59 he led a quintet that included Curtis Fuller, Hugh Lawson, Louis Hayes and Ernie Farrell.\nYusef first began recording under his own name in 1956 for Savoy Records\n, and has since made more than 100 recordings as a leader for the Savoy\n, Prestige, Contemporary, Impulse, Atlantic and YAL\n labels. His early recordings of such songs as “Love Theme from Spartacus” and “Morning” continue to receive extensive airplay even today. He also toured and recorded with the ensembles of Charles Mingus, Cannonball Adderley, Miles Davis, Dizzy\n Gillespie and Babatunde Olatunji in the 1960s.\nAs an instrumentalist with his own ensemble, Yusef Lateef has performed extensively in concert halls and at colleges and music festivals throughout the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Russia, Japan and Africa, often conducting master classes and symposia in conjunction with his performances.\nDr. Lateef’s first major work for large orchestra was his Blues Suite, also known as “Suite 16,” premiered in 1969 by the Augusta, GA Symphony Orchestra\n and performed in 1970 with his hometown Detroit Symphony Orchestra\n . In 1992, Yusef Lateef formed his own label, YAL Records\n, to record and distribute his works and those of other artists including the Eternal Wind Quintet.\nIn 1993 the WDR Orchestra\n producer Ulrich Kurtz commissioned Yusef Lateef’s most ambitious work to date, The African American Epic Suite, a four-movement work for quintet and orchestra representing 400 years of slavery and disfranchisement of African Americans in America. As a virtuoso on a broad spectrum of reed instruments -- tenor saxophone, flute, oboe, bamboo flute, shanai, shofar, argol, sarewa, and taiwan koto — Lateef has introduced delightful new sounds and blends of tone colours to audiences all over the world, and he has incorporated the sounds of many countries into his own music. In 1987 he won a Grammy Award for his recording of “Yusef Lateef’s Little Symphony”, on which he performed all the parts.\n   "

                "__text": "\n      \n\n      \n\n      mounir fatmi’s installations, sculptures, videos, photographs, paintings and drawings audaciously tease and confront proprieties. He questions, plays and provokes with caustic insolence, taking on notions of power, and all kinds of extremism; the religious, the political, as well as their means; architecture and media.He selects rather basic materials, often on the verge of extinction (as with the VHS\n cassettes and the coaxial cable), yet as seen with the saw blades or wooden horse jumps, they always elicit relevant connotations. Although aesthetically very seductive, mounir fatmi’s work offers a look at the world from another angle, refusing to be blinded by conventions.\nmounir fatmi was born in Tangiers, Morocco in 1970. He graduated in Fine Arts in Casablanca in 1989 and in Rome in 1991. He currently lives and works in Paris, France.\nmounir fatmi’s work has been exhibited worldwide, like at the Migros Museum\n für Gegenwarskunst, Zürich, Switzerland, the Museum Kunst Palast\n , Düsseldorf, Germany, the Centre Georges Pompidou\n , Paris, France, and the Mori Art Museum\n in Tokyo, Japan.\nHe has also participated in several biennales amongst which; the Gwangju Biennale\n, Korea, the 2nd Sevilla Biennale\n, Spain, the 8th Sharjah Biennale\n, United Arab Emirates, the 52nd Venice Biennale\n, Italy, the 10th Lyon Biennale\n, France, the Cuvée Biennale\n, Linz, Austria.\n   "
